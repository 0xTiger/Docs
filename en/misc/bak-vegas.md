## What is a BAK file?

A .bak file in the context of "VEGAS Video Project Backup" typically refers to a backup file created by the VEGAS Pro video editing software. VEGAS Pro is a popular video editing program used for creating and editing videos.

When you work on a video project in VEGAS Pro, the software may automatically create backup (.bak) files to help protect your work in case of unexpected software crashes or other issues. These backup files contain a copy of your project at a specific point in time and can be used to recover your work in case the original project file becomes corrupted or inaccessible.

VEGAS Pro automatically generate these .bak files as you work on your project, and they are typically stored in the same directory as your original project file. When it comes to naming, VEGAS Pro follows a convention by appending the ".bak" extension to the name of your primary project file. For instance, if your project file is named "MyProject.veg," the corresponding backup file may be labeled as "MyProject.bak." 

Typically, VEGAS BAK files are located in the following directory:

```
C:\Users\<USERNAME>\AppData\Local\VEGAS Pro\
```
