## WHat is a BPS file?

A .BPS file is essentially a backup of a word processing document created with Microsoft Works, which typically uses the .WPS file extension for its documents. These .BPS files are often generated automatically by Microsoft Works as a precaution in case the program crashes while you're working on a document. It is a way to safeguard your work and prevent data loss.

In the following section, we will explore the software applications associated with BPS files.

## Microsoft Works

Microsoft Works was a productivity software suite developed by Microsoft. It was first introduced in 1987 and gained popularity as a more affordable alternative to the full Microsoft Office suite. Microsoft Works included several basic office applications, such as:

- **Word Processor:** Microsoft Works had a word processing application that allowed users to create and edit documents. It used the [.WPS](/word-processing/wps/) file format for word processing documents.

- **Spreadsheet:** It included a spreadsheet application for creating and managing spreadsheets. The file format for spreadsheets was [.XLR](/spreadsheet/xlr/).

- **Database:** Microsoft Works also had a database application for organizing and managing data. The file format for database files was [.WDB](/database/wdb/).

- **Calendar and Address Book:** In addition to the core office applications, Microsoft Works often included tools for managing calendars and address books.

- **Works Word Processor Format (.WPS):** The native file format of the word processing component of Microsoft Works. .WPS files contained text, formatting, and simple graphics.

- **Discontinuation:** Microsoft officially discontinued Microsoft Works in 2007 and encouraged users to switch to Microsoft Office or other alternatives.
