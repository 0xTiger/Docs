## What is an XMP file?

XMP files are metadata that contain the edits made to a camera raw file, such as an .CR2 or NEF. They're automatically generated and saved in the same directory alongside their corresponding jpeg images. XMP was created by Adobe Systems Inc. for creation, processing, and interchange of standardized and custom metadata for digital documents and data sets. It was accepted as an **ISO standard 16684-1:2019 part 1 & ISO 16684-2:2014 part 2**. XMP is a registered trademark of Adobe Systems Incorporated.

## XMP File Format - More Information

XMP is a serialization format based on the data model approach. It establishes the principals for the definition and processing of metadata. The format can be used to embed XMP information into different type of files such as images, video, and documents e.g. [JPEG](/image/jpeg/) and [PDF](/pdf/).

## What is inside an XMP file?

XMP files contain metadata information about various aspects of the raw image. It supports data such as:

 * Author and Copyright Information
 * Image appearance properties information such as brightness, exposure, contrast, crop angle, shadow, saturation, sharpness, tint, and temperature
