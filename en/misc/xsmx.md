## What is an XMZX file?

An XMZX file is a questionnaire file created with ExamSoft SofTest application that is used to conduct exams. It is used to send the exam paper to students that they take online and submit the result back as XMDX file. ExamSoft provides assessment solutions based on data-driver decisions through education technology and SofTest application available for both Windows and MacOS is one of these. The XMZX file contains all the questions and is opened in the SofTest application on student's computer.

## XMZX File Format

The XMZX files are saved and sent to exam takers as password protected files. The password protection is meant to ensure the security and secrecy of the exam questions. Password of the exam is shared with end user for opening the file and taking the test.
