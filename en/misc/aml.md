## What is an AML file?

An AML (Automation Markup Language) file is a data file that is used to store and exchange plant engineering information. It is based on the XML file format, making the exchange of information based on open standards. AutomationML provides the possibility to interconnect modern engineering tools in the fields of mechanical plant engineering, electrical design, programmable logic controllers, and robot control. AML files can be viewed and edited using AutomationML Editor tool.

## AML File Format

AML uses [XML](/web/xml/) based object-oriented data modelling for storage and exchange of engineering models. Engineering plant components are represented as objects having different aspects, with each object having the ability to act as sub-objects. Thus, each smaller or larger model can be described. The [AutomationML Specifications](https://www.automationml.org/about-automationml/specifications/) provides a short guide for getting started with the details of this modelling language.

## Getting Started with AML

Using AML for exchange of engineering information requires certain knowledge for successful application. The implementation of new applications need several steps for this purpose as below.

 * Know the architecture
 * Gaining basic knowledge
 * Examining the use case
 * Application-specific mapping and modelling
 * Implementation
