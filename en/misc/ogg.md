## What is an OGG file?

An OGG file is a graph file created with the Origin software. It provides capability to store different type of graphs to display imported data for data analysis. Graph types supported by OGG file type include column, bar, pie, waterfall, 3D, polar, and symbol. Origin software was developed by OriginLab and lets users perform data analysis and generate output as graphs.

## OGG File Format

OGG files contain graphs for representation of imported data. When an OGG file is opened, it displays the graph in a separate window in Origin or Origin Viewer which is freely available as compared to Origin software. Metadata information such as title and colors of a graph are also stored inside the OGG file.

## About OriginLab Origin software

Origin software also provides the option to be used as an Automation Server. In such case, client applications e.g. LabVIEW, Microsoft Excel, Python, or custom developed applications in C#/VB/VC can exchange data with Origin. [Python_to_OriginLab](https://github.com/jsbangsund/python_to_originlab) is a Python API to automate sending data and basic plotting functions in OriginLab.
