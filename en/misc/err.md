## What is an ERR file?

An ERR file is a log file generated by AutoCAD to record information about any abnormal behaviour of the application. It includes information about incidents such as application crash, or any other similar events. This helps in improvement of the application by carrying out diagnosis of the problem. An ERR file may log information about the date and time, name of the drawing file opened that causes the application to crash, and description of the error. ERR files can be opened with
Autodesk AutoCAD 2023.

## ERR File Format

ERR files are saved to disc as plain text files and can be also be view in a text editor. Most commonly found ERR files include **acad.err** that helps diagnose the issue. It should be noted, however, that not all errors are recorded in an ERR file such as the unrecognized command and invalid block name errors.
