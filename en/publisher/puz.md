## What is a PUZ file?

A file with .puz extension is a compressed archive that contains a standard Microsoft Publisher [.pub](/publisher/pub/) document. As a result of compression, it is smaller in size and easy to transfer via internet or other devices. PUZ files can be unpacked/opened using the Microsoft Unpack utility.

## PUZ File Format

 A PUZ file is a compressed archive that contains the standard PUB file along with other files. It contains all the required files to unpack, display, and print the publication.

 A PUZ file contains the following.

  * `Unpack.exe` - a software utility to unpack compressed files
  * `ReadMe.txt` - a description files
  * `Compressed .puz file` - Contains the publication and may include embedded fonts and linked graphics.

### Unpacking PUZ File

The packed Publisher files can be unpacked using the Unpack.exe utility. It extracts the packed PUZ file to the choice of directory as selected by user.
