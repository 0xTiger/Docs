## What is an SNB file?
The file with .snb extension; belongs to the Samsung mobile devices. When Galaxy S Note phones create a note by using a typical software (advanced note-taking application developed by Samsung), that note is actually saved as a file with .snb extension in the memory of the smart phones (e.g. Galaxy S and Galaxy Note). A note file may contain sketches, text, video, audio, and images. The SNB files have been discontinued by the Samsung and these files have been replaced by .SPD files. Hence, you may not find a lot of information about this typical file type over the internet.
