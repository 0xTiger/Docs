## What is an SNB file?

The file with the .snb extension; belongs to the Samsung mobile devices. When Galaxy S Note phones create a note by using a typical software (advanced note-taking application developed by Samsung), that note is actually saved as a file with .snb extension in the memory of the smart phones (e.g. Galaxy S and Galaxy Note). A note file may contain sketches, text, video, audio, and images. The SNB files have been discontinued by Samsung and these files have been replaced by [SPD](/ebook/snb/) files. Hence, you may not find a lot of information about this typical file type over the internet.
