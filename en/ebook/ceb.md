## What is a CEB file?
The files with .CEB (Chinese ebook)extension are known as **Apabi eBook files**. A CEB file includes chinese formatted text and other layout information, therefore, this file format has been discontinued.

## Breif history of CEB file format
The CEB format file was developed by Founder Electronics's Apabi publishers. The files of this format are available from the APABI D-Lib library which includes a collection of Chinese eBooks. These files are actually encoded binary files which can be read using **Apabi Reader 4.5** software. The [Iliad e-book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ILiad) device included an Apabi viewer. This device was also capable to use electronic paper display like **Sony Reader** and **Amazon Kindle** etc. Therefore the Iliad e-book device was out of the market in 2010.
