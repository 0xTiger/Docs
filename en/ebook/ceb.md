## What is a CEB file?
The files with .CEB (Chinese ebook)extension are known as **Apabi eBook files**. A CEB file includes chinese formatted text and other layout information, therefore, this file format has been discontinued. The CEB format file was developed by Founder Electronics's Apabi publishers. The files of this format are available from the APABI D-Lib library which includes a collection of Chinese eBooks. These files are actually encoded binary files which can be read using **Apabi Reader 4.5** software. The [Iliad e-book](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ILiad) device included an Apabi viewer. This device was also capable to use electronic paper display like **Sony Reader** and **Amazon Kindle** etc. Therefore the Iliad e-book device was out of the market in 2010.
