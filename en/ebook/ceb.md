## What is a CEB file?

The files with the .ceb (Chinese ebook) extension are known as **Apabi eBook files**. A CEB file includes Chinese formatted text and other layout information, therefore, this file format has been discontinued. The CEB format file was developed by Founder Electronics's Apabi publishers. The files of this format are available from the APABI D-Lib library which includes a collection of Chinese eBooks. These files are actually encoded binary files which can be read using **Apabi Reader 4.5** software. The [Iliad eBook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ILiad) device included an Apabi viewer. The Iliad eBook device was out of the market in 2010.
