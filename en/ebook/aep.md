## What is an AEP file?

The file with .aep extension (which stands for **Activ E-Book Project**) is classified as electronic books (e-books). The AEP files are created by using the same engine as that of Internet Explorer to ensure 100% compatibility. It contains the pages like a person can read a physical book. The pages of AEP files usually include the text, images, animations and hyperlinks. Also, it supports HTML, DHTML, JPEG and PNG graphics, animations, JavaScript, VBScript, and many of the Internet Explorer plug-ins. An AEP file can be saved as a Windows executable file (EXE) so that it can be opened on Windows95 or later versions of Microsoft Windows.

The AEP files are created by using an AEC (Active E-Book Compiler) software. This software is using the similar engine as of that IE to create e-books. The user can create unlimited copies of e-books without paying any cost for the usage of the program. The distribution process is also easy as every e-book is composed as a self-contained Windows program, which can be distributed on any media like e-mails, Internet download, floppy disk, CD-ROMs, ZIP disks etc..
