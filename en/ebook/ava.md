## What is an AVA file?
The AVA files are actually belong to a persian e-book reading software known as AvaaPlayer. It seems a discontinued software; as we don't have any copy or information available on the internet. The Adobe Systems Incorporated the .ava file extension in their e-book reading software, but later on they stopped to provide services for Iranians. The data analysis shows that the AvaaPlayer users are mostly using Windows operating system; and they opened the software mostly in Google Chrome browser. Here are also many advanced Iranian e-book reading softwares available on app stores. Fidibo, Taaghche and Ketab-Rah are the most popular e-book service providers in the persian e-book market.
