## What is an EA file?
The EA extension is used for the **Kindle End Action** files. These files are created by the **Amazon Kindle e-reading device** to show something which an author wants to display at the end of an ebook. An EA file contains the information in XML format. 

## Little more about EA file format
A file with .EA extension is an xml file that contains the data for the customers who bought the book and also bought a feature to show more about the author after the last page of the e-book; including ASIN so it can jump to the title's Kindle Store page.
