## What is an EA file?
The .ea extension is used for the **Kindle End Action** files. These files are created by the **Amazon Kindle e-reading device** to show something which an author wants to display at the end of an ebook. An EA file contains the information in [XML](https://docs.fileformat.com/web/xml/) format. 

## Little more about EA file format
A file with .ea extension is an xml file that contains the data for the customers who bought the book and also bought a feature to show more about the author after the last page of the e-book; including **ASIN** or **ISBN** so it can jump to the title's Kindle Store page. 

## What is an ASIN/ISBN? 
The ASIN stands for **Amazon Standard Identification Number** which is actually a a ten digit alphanumeric code to uniquely identify the products on Amazon. The ASIN is a unique identifier for each product and is assigned when you create an Amazon product. Each and every product on Amazon has an ASIN with the exception of books. The Amazon uses the ISBN (International Standard Book Number) in place of an ASIN. This Amazon identifier for your products is necessary to get before you sell them on Amazon.
