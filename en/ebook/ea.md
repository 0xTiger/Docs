## What is an EA file? ##

The .ea extension is used for the **Kindle End Action** file which is one of the Kindle file formats. These files are created by the **Amazon Kindle e-reading device** to show something which an author wants to display at the end of an ebook. An EA file contains the information in [XML](/web/xml/) format. So this file can be opened or viewed by using any text editor. This file can be found where the Kindle e-reading devices save the e-books. The content in it might be empty XML tags if the customer hadn't set the information to display at the end of an eBook.  

## Little more about EA file format ##

A file with .ea extension is an XML file that contains the data for the customers who bought the book and also bought a feature to show more about the author after the last page of the e-book; including **ASIN** or **ISBN** so it can jump to the title's Kindle Store page. 

### What is an ASIN/ISBN?  ###

The ASIN stands for **Amazon Standard Identification Number** which is actually a ten-digit alphanumeric code to uniquely identify the products on Amazon. The ASIN is a unique identifier for each product and is assigned when you create an Amazon product. Each and every product on Amazon has an ASIN with the exception of books. Amazon uses the ISBN (International Standard Book Number) in place of an ASIN. This Amazon identifier for your products is necessary to get before you sell them on Amazon.

## Problem to open an EA file?

If you are not being able to open and run the EA file; it doesn't mean that you do not have a suitable software installed on your device. There might be some other issues which prevent the file to work properly. The possible problems might be one of the following:

- Corruption of a EA file.
- Wrong links to the EA file in registry entries.
- Deleted description of the EA from the Windows registry
- Corrupted installation of an application that supports the EA format
- An infected EA file with an undesirable malware.
- The computer does not have sufficient hardware resources to operate the EA file.
- Drivers used by the computer to open a EA file are out dated.
