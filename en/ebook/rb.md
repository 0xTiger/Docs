## What is an RB file?

The file with extension .rb holds the Rocket eBook content. The Rocket eBook is actually a device made by Nuvo Media; they released this device in 1998. Although Rocket eBook is capable of displaying images, but only in black and white display. It has the screen of 106 dpi or 480 x 320 pixels on a 4.5 x 3 inch touch screen. The Rocket eBook connects to a computer via a serial port connection to download eBooks in RB file format. The RB files are capable to use DRM but this technology is not being used in modern e-books. The RB file conventionally contains an HTML file with the images and a pseudo-OPF file with all of the metadata (.info).
