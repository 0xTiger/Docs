## What is a BKK file?

The files with the .bkk extension are being used by **BookBuddi** software and these files can be read back using Microsoft Text to Speech Agent. These files may include text, images and may consist of multiple pages. When the text is being read the respective section is highlighted and pages are turned automatically.

## BKK File Format

The content of the BKK file format is referenced by the BookBuddi app when a user views or edits the associated BKK file. These reference details also include text and image formatting attributes among other page layout elements entered by the creator of the BKK ebook. The Microsoft Text to Speech Agent, an application that belongs to the systems, is helpful in aiding users in accessing digital content stored in these BKK ebooks since this application supports a feature that reads back the text content of an eBook into spoken audio.
