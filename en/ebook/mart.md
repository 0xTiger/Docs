## What is a MART file?
The MART files are known as e-publication files used by the MartView software. These files can be extracted pages from a magazine or book and contain page information. The MART files are used to download and render the e-publications using the **MartView reader** program.

## MartView files in depth

The Martview is an e-book reader for the Windows operating system which is available at free of cost. It supports the pdf document format and its own  files with .mart extension. The developers should focus on the format support aspects and they need to add as many as possible formats support. They should at least add support for commonly used ebook formats like [.epub](https://docs.fileformat.com/ebook/epub/), [.docx](https://docs.fileformat.com/word-processing/docx/), [.txt](https://docs.fileformat.com/word-processing/txt/) and [.azw](https://docs.fileformat.com/ebook/azw/). The MART files can be created from [PDF](https://docs.fileformat.com/pdf/) files, [zips](https://docs.fileformat.com/compression/zip/), comic book archives, [JPG](https://docs.fileformat.com/image/jpeg/), [GIF](https://docs.fileformat.com/image/gif/), [PNG](https://docs.fileformat.com/image/png/) and [BMP](https://docs.fileformat.com/image/bmp/). 

The MART files may be well suited for single files working, but if you many ebooks in different formats, then you surely do not want to spend time to convert all of them into a single format just to be able to read them in the ebook reader.
