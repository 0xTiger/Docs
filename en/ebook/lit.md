## What is a LIT file?

The LIT files belong to the ancient **Microsoft Reader** which was used to read e-books. The e-books which are displayed by Microsoft Reader have the extension **.lit** which is shortened of **Literature**. The LIT file format consists of a Microsoft ITOL/ITLS HTML Help 2.0 file, which gives all sorts of amazing features like LZX compression, binary representation of markup material, and arbitrary optional auxiliary data associated with each stream. Book text is an arbitrary number of OEBPS 1.0 markup streams and a subset of OEBPS 1.0 CSS. Images are GIF, JPEG, and PNG.  

## How much time Microsoft Reader displayed the LIT files

The **Microsoft Reader** is an application for reading e-books which has been discontinued by Microsoft. The first version of Microsoft Reader was released in August 2000, that used its own .LIT format. It was available for PDAs and Windows computers. The name of the app was also used later for an application (which was initially released with Windows 8) for reading PDF and XPS files. The Microsoft Reader application was discontinued in 2018.
