## What is an MBP file?

An MBP file is known as the **Mobipocket Notes** File but it doesn't contain the eBook itself; it contains the e-book notes which are created by users in an e-book such as corrections, annotations, drawings, as well as some other important marks. The MBP files just refer to the notes that the users added while reading a certain eBook. In other words, we can say eBooks allow users to add some notes where they want while reading and those notes that are marked are usually saved using the **.mbp** extension.

## Brief explanation about Mobipocket Notes file

The above paragraph shows that Mobipocket Notes facilitate the users to add some notes where necessary and these notes saved in an MBP file. Since these files are entirely associated with an eBook file as they are contained within an eBook, they are usually saved with the e-book too and are located in a similar location where the eBook file is saved. These files are usually produced by the **MBP Reader** or **Mobipocket Reader Desktop** program, which is an application useful for reading books electronically. The MBP files are saved in binary format and can be opened using an MBP reader utility.
