## What is a CEBX file?
The files with .CEBX (Chinese ebook) extension are known as **Apabi eBook files** which actually replaced the [CEB](https://docs.fileformat.com/ebook/ceb) file format. A CEBX file includes chinese formatted text and other layout information, therefore, this file format has been discontinued.
