## What is a CBR file?

A file with .cbr extension is a collection of image, stored as compressed binary file using the RAR compression file format. It contains images in [JPEG](/image/jpeg/), [PNG](/image/png/) or [GIF](/image/gif/) images that represent images in a comic and are shown to user when the file is used in ebook readers such as Calibre. CBR is similar to [CBZ](/compression/cbz/) other than that CBZ is compressed and stored in the [ZIP](/compression/zip/) file format. These files can be contained inside comic book collection files such as [CBC](/ebook/cbc/).

## CBR File Format

A CBR file is a RAR archive that is stored as a binary file to the disc. The images inside a CBR file are stored and displayed to users in ordered manner when opened by ebook reader. CBR files can be decompressed using any decompression software that supports [RAR](/compression/rar/) file format. However, images decompressed this way are not in the same order as they appear in the visual display when opened in reader software.
