## Waht is an AZW file?

AZW is a digital ebook file format developed by Amazon for its Kindle devices. The format was adopted from MobiPocket eBook [MOBI](/ebook/mobi/) file format and DRM protection was applied for their usage on Kindle devices only. AZW files can store things like formatted text, bookmarks, and other information as is part of the Mobipocket .PRC files. DRM protected AZW files can't be read by other devices and can be read using Kindle devices. AZW files can be converted to a number of other file formats such as [PDF](/pdf/), [EPUB](/ebook/epub/), AZW3, [DOCX](/word-processing/docx/), and [RTF](/word-processing/rtf/). AZW files have internet media type application/vnd.amazon.mobi8-ebook.
