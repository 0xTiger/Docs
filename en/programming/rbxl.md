## What is a RBXL file?

An RBXL file is a Roblox location file that contains location defined in 3D world inside the [Roblox game](https://www.roblox.com/). Roblox itself is a multiplayer building game that allows players to build games using the developer tools provided by the platform. RBXL files use tools, scripts, teams and parts to describe playing field as 3D models. The Roblox Studio lets player create the gaming items and can be used to open RBXL files.

## RBXL File Format

RBXL files are developed using the Roblox Studio and saved in [XML](/web/xml/) file format. Due to this universal file format, there are plenty of tools and APIs that let you create and open these files. One such API is the [MaximumADHD](https://github.com/MaximumADHD/Roblox-File-Format), a [C#](/programming/cs/) library to create and manipulate files in Roblox's model/place file format.
