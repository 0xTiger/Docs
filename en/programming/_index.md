Programming files are source code files that are used by programming languages to write software applications to perform certain tasks. Each programming language has its own syntax and carries its own set of files for writing code in the form of libraries, header files, classes, or constants. Based on the programming language used, the source code file format will be different to obey the syntax rule defined by that language. 

Common developer or programming file extensions and their associated file formats include **[C#](/programming/cs/)** (CSharp Source Code File), **[CPP](/programming/cpp/)** (C++ Source File) and **[VB](/programming/vb/)** (Visual Basic Source Code File).
