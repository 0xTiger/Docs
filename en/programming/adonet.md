Microsoft has created  ADO.NET (ActiveX Data Object) as part of its .NET framework that can access any kind of data source as a database access technology. It's a conventional object-oriented program that provides a set of data mechanisms to generate high-performance, consistent, and accessible database applications. ADO.NET model offers constant access to data sources such as SQL Server and XML and data sources visible through OLE DB and ODBC. ADO.NET is very effective for data-sharing consumer applications to connect data sources to recover, handle, and update the data.

The ADO.NET model is designed to allow developers to generate data access applications by programming against a theoretical application model as a substitute of programming right against an interactive storage schema. The main objective is to reduce the amount of code and maintenance required for data-oriented applications. Among the front-end controls and the back-end database ADO.NET functions as a link. The ADO.NET objects summarize all the data access actions.

The .NET framework offers three different types of data providers: SQL, OleDb, and ODBC. Microsoft is also functioning as a data provider for Oracle database and other Database Management System (DBMS) suppliers.

## How ADO.NET Model Uses XML? ##

In the ADO.NET model, XML plays a very important role as it utilizes XML to store the data in the cache and transfer the data among applications. Datasets use XML schemas to store and allocate data among applications. The XML file can be used from other applications without cooperating with the actual dataset.

## Advantages of ADO.NET ##

ADO.NET offers numerous advantages as compared to other Microsoft data access technologies.

 *	The ADO.NET modules are easy to function because of their object-oriented nature. In this model, it's easy to use more than one data provider to access a single data source
 *	The ADO .NET classes can easily be managed
 *	XML is widely used for sharing data among applications over the Internet. ADO.NET data can easily be stored and shifted easily in XML format
 *	.NET offers ADO .NET mechanisms to work in visual form. All the components of these ADO.NET can be used as by other windows controls. Through this, it is very helpful for programmers to write less code and develop applications effectively
 *	Performance and scalability play a very important role while developing web-based applications and services. Due to connection bandwidth limits and swiftly increasing traffic, transferring data from one source to another is expensive over the Internet. Using disconnected stored data in XML is the solution to this issue
