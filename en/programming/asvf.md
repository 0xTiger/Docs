## What is an ASVF file?

An ASVF file is a compressed file created by Asphyre Sphinx software which is a 2D/3D framework for industrial and enterprise applications. It stores data such as fonts, images, and other media. Sphinx can also be used to developed 2D/3D video games. A compressed ASVF file may contain common files such as .JPEG and .XML files.

ASVF files can be opened with Asphyre Sphinx software that has been discontinued since long now.

## ASVF File Format
