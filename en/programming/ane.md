## What is an ANE file?

An ANE file is an Adobe Air Native Extension file that is used by developers to write specific functions that invokes [Adobe ActionScript](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ActionScript) code. In most of the cases, the ANE files contains the native code library used by the extension. However, the file itself is installed on the device. It allows system specific functions such as device vibration. Adobe AIR applications should be be compiled to use dynamic linking for utilizing the ANE file.

## ANE File Format - More Information

ANE files are saved to disc as binary files whose file format specifications are not available publicly. An ANE file may contain native Android Java source code to access Android device functionality such as invoking volume or vibrate functions. All this is done by wrapping the native system in Adobe's ActionScript language.
