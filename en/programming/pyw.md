## What is a PYW file?

A PYW is a Python script file that is executed to display the graphical user interface (GUI) of a Python application. It is associated with Python by Python Software Foundation and are executed/run using PythonW instead of Python. When executed, the PYW launches a GUI instead of a DOS console from popping up for displaying the output. Thus, Python actually runs the script in background.

## PYW File Format

PYW files are stored as text script files and can be executed with pythonw on Mac, Windows and Linux OS.

## What is the difference between Python and Pythonw?

python.exe is associated with . py files and opens and runs in a terminal window. pythonw.exe is associated with . pyw files and does not open the terminal.

The PYW file type is primarily associated with Python by Python Software Foundation. PYW files are used in Windows to indicate a script needs to be run using PYTHONW. EXE instead of PYTHON. EXE in order to prevent a DOS console from popping up to display the output.
