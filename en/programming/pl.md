## What is a PL file? ##

This specific type of file format deals with a programming language known as Perl. These files contain the source code of this language. For compilation and to run the code of the Perl language a specific Perl Interpreter is used. 

Perl is a scripting language and lines of code, variables, and comments are included in this file format. There is complexity and difficulty in understanding and reading these files as these contain code of specific syntax of Perl language. These files and this language are compatible with Windows, macOS, and Linux. 

The PL files can be easily accessed by downloading and installing appropriate programs specified for this language and keeping in view the nature of the OS (either the downloaded program is compatible with Window or macOS).


## Brief History ##

This language was first kept in use in 1987, so these files got their origin in that year. In 1989 the Perl 2 was released. Later on, it has been updated and has been modified up to the 5.35 version, and the next version is targeted to be released next year.

In every update, there have been added tools about the functionality, performance, and look of the language and files. There have been many revisions about the versions in these years. It was originally a basic scripting language but now it comprises many other modules too. Originally, it was a very simple language, but the scripts of this language were quite difficult to understand as they were compact.

## File Format Specifications ##

There are some properties or specifications of these programming files, some of them are as follows:

*	The code included in these files is in plain text format and used for script development
*	Scripting of server, parsing of text, and server administration are the main aspects that the script of this language covers
*	Many popular programs that are associated with this language are Active state Active Perl and Bare Bones BBEdit (compatible with Mac OS)
*	This language is considered a high-level language
*	For Win32, the user may have to install native binary distribution of the language
*	It requires some scripting tools to become executable in various Windows Resource Kits
*	Visual Studio .NET is a famous framework for the development of programming languages. The Active State tool known as Visual Perl is used to add Perl into Visual studio
*	In the files, the first line of the source code describes the information of the interpreter being used. The PL files usually starts with #!/usr/local/bin/perl line that tells your computer to run this script using a Perl interpreter installed in the computer
