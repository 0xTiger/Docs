## What is a SCALA file?

A SCALA file is source code file created with the Scala (Scalable language) programming language. It contains the source code written in the object-oriented and functional programming which is the basic theme of Scala language. Scale facilitates to build high-performance systems with its JVM and JavaScript runtimes. This further allows support of higher-order functions and nesting of function definitions. Scala development was started in 2003 by Martin Odersky and his research group at EPFL.

## SCALA File Format

A SCALA file is saved as plain text file that can be opened with any text editor such as Scala IDE for Eclipse, Notepad, Notepad++, and TextEdit. A single SCALA file can have source code comprising of classes, interfaces, raw strings, and operator overloaded methods. The best feature of Scala is that the code can be compiled to Java byte that can be run on JVM.

### Scala Language in a Nutshell

 * **Seamless Java Interop** - Scala and Java stacks can be mixed for seamless integration due to the fact that Scala runs on the JVM.
 * **Type Interface** - So the type system doesn’t feel so static. Don’t work for the type system. Let the type system work for you!
 * **Concurrency & Distribution** - Supports data-parallel operations on collections, use actors for concurrency and distribution, or futures for asynchronous programming.
 * **Pattern Matching** - Support for match against class hierarchies, sequences, constants and more.
 * **Higher-Order Functions** - Functions are first-class objects that can be composed with guaranteed type safety.
