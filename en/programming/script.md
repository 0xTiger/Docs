## What is a SCRIPT file?

A SCRIPT file is a source file that contains script in any scripting language. This makes it a generalized scripting file that contains variables and functions. Since each scripting language may be different, the script written inside a SCRIPT file needs to be executed using appropriate scripting engine.

## SCRIPT File Format - More Information

SCRIPT files are stored to disc in plain text files. These can be opened and edited with any text editor such as Microsoft Notepad, Notepad++, and Apple TextEdit. Since the scripting language can be different, it can be executed by renaming the file extension to respective scripting language's default extension. For example, there are several common scripting languages such as JavaScript ([.JS](/web/js/)), VBScript ([.VBS](/programming/vbs/)), AppleScript (.SCPT), PHP ([.PHP](/programming/php/)), and ASP ([.ASP](/web/asp/)).
