## What is an ASI file? ##

An ASI file is a variable file format used by the Alpha Five software that is used for developing Web applications. It stores variables used by the Web application. When you create a new developer project in Alpha Five, the ASI file is also created and saved along side the Alpha Five developer project.

ASI files can be opened with Alpha Software Alpha Anywhere.

## ASI File Format

ASI files are saved in Alpha Five proprietary file format. They are read and wrote by the application as part of the developer project.
