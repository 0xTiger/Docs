## What is a APS file format?
An APS File is created by Visual C++, a software development application by Microsoft. It saves the binary representation of a resource incorporated with the project and it allows the application to load resources more rapidly. You can easily find these files with .aps file extension. In fact resource editors don't directly read  resource.h files that's why the resource compiler compiles them into .aps files that are consumed by the resource editors. Hence, the APS file format is just a compile step and only stores symbolic data. The non-symbolic information such as commenting is discarded during the compile process. For example, when you Save, the resource editor overwrites the resource script file and the resource.h file. Any changes to the resources themselves remain incorporated in the resource script file, but comments will always be lost once the resource script file is overwritten.

- Install the well suited software to run the file.
- If still you are facing difficulty to open the .aps file; you must check the version of the software and see either that is supporting .aps files or not. Some files can be supported by the old version and some by the latest one so, must check the details.
- After installing the appropriate verion of software make sure that it is set as the default application to open APS files.
