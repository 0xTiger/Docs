## What is an ALB file?

An ALB file is a library file used by the **Alpha Five** IDE application that is used for developing Web applications. Its primary purpose is to store information for corresponding Alpha Five [ADB file](/database/adb/). This includes data dictionary information such as settings, script pointers, menus, user-defined functions, bitmaps, toolbars, and import definitions.

ALB files can be opened with **Alpha Software Alpha Anywhere**.

## ALB File Format - More Information

ALB files are saved in Alpha File proprietary file format and their internal file format structure is not available publicly. These are saved in addition to the overall Alpha Five developer library database. Being libraries, ALB files can be reused in other Alpha Five applications.
