## What is a YPR file?

A YPR file is a project file created by the visual programming environment BYOB (Build Your Own Blocks). It contains information about the visual arrangement of blocks and programming work flows between these blocks. Together these blocks define the overall data and logic of the application program. YPR project file contains all the other related information to save and load projects. BYOB was initially extension of MIT's Scratch software (a project of the Lifelong Kindergarten Group at the MIT Media Lab) and is now developed as [Snap](https://snap.berkeley.edu/about).

## YPR File Format - More Information

YPR files are saved to disc as binary files and their internal file format details are not known. BYOB projects are fun building where blocks are dragged and dropped to develop the programming work flow.

### YPR Data Types

Snap extended the Scratch's list first class, allowing to create its data structures (trees, heaps, hash tables, dictionaries, and so on). A first class data type in a programming language can be:

 * the value of a variable
 * a member of an aggregate (array, list, etc.)
 * an argument (input) to a procedure
 * the value returned by a procedure
 * used without having a name (being the value of a variable)
