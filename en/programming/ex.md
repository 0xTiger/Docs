## What is an EX file?

An EX file is a source code file that contains source code for applications developed using Euphoria programming language. Euphoria is a procedural programming language that believes in simplicity of programming rather than complex programming languages. An application developed in Euphoria can comprise of multiple EX files, but a single EX file can also contain complete source of the program.

Applications that can **open EX files** include openEuphoria Euphoria, Microsoft Notepad, Notepad++, and Atom.

## Brief History of EX File Format

The development and existence of EX file format is linked with the development of Euphoria programming language which was created by Robert Craig. It was first released for MS-DOS. It became open-source software in 2006 with the release of version 3. Its development was taken over by the **openEuphoria group** that administers and develops the project. It's version 4 was released in December 2010 and is available for Windows, Linux, macOS and three flavors of BSD.

The Euphoria was initially written in **[C](/programming/c/)** programming language. Later, Euphoria interpreter was split in two parts:

 * `Front-end Parser` - written in Euphoria and is used with the Euphoria-to-C translator and the Binder.
 * `Back-end` - run time library written in C programming language.

## EX File Format - More Information

EX files are stored as plain text files and contain the source code for programs written in Euphoria programming language. These files can be opened in any text editor.
