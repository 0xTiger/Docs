## About 3DS to FBX

The .3ds file extension is indicative of the 3D Studio (DOS) mesh file format utilized by Autodesk's 3D Studio software. Autodesk 3D Studio has held a significant presence in the realm of 3D file formats since the 1990s and has subsequently evolved into 3D Studio MAX.

FilmBox, often known as [FBX](/3d/fbx/), is a widely embraced 3D file format that was initially created by Kaydara to ensure compatibility with MotionBuilder. Autodesk Inc. took over the format in 2006, solidifying its position as a critical standard for effortlessly sharing 3D data across various 3D software applications.

Converting [3DS](/3d/3ds/) files to the FBX format is a frequent need, and various online applications offer free 3DS to FBX conversion. If you're a software developer looking to integrate 3DS to FBX functionality into your .NET, Java, or Python application, you might find the Aspose.3D APIs a valuable solution for this task.
