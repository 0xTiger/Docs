## About FBX to DAE

FBX, short for FilmBox, is a widely embraced 3D file format that Kaydara initially created to enhance compatibility with MotionBuilder. In 2006, Autodesk Inc. took over this format, solidifying its status as a fundamental standard for effortless 3D data exchange across various 3D software applications.

A DAE file, short for Digital Asset Exchange file, serves as a format for transferring data between interactive 3D applications. It relies on the COLLADA (COLLAborative Design Activity) XML schema, which represents an open standard for exchanging digital assets among various graphics software applications.
