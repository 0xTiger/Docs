## What is a DBM file?

A DBM (Daz Brick Material) file is a Shader Mixer network file created with 3D character modeling application, **DAZ Studio**. It describes the material of the 3D mode i.e. surface/displacement/interior volume. DAZ allows you to create your own custom shader by connecting a series of bricks together. This combines collectively as a DBM file that forms a shader network. It is the DBM file that specifies how a material is shaded.

Applications that can **open DBM files** include DAZ 3D DAZ Studio 4.

## DBM File Format

DBM files are saved to disc in [XML](/web/xml/) file format.
