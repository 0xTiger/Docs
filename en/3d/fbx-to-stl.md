## About FBX to STL

FBX, FilmBox, is a popular 3D file format that was developed by Kaydara for MotionBuilder. It was acquired by Autodesk Inc in 2006 and is now one of the main 3D data exchange file format used by many 3D tools. [STL](/cad/stl/), abbreviation for stereolithrography, is an interchangeable file format for representation of 3-Dimensional surface geometry.

It is a common requirement to convert [FBX](/3d/fbx/) to STL file format and several apps are available online that can convert FBX to STL for FREE. If you are an application developer who is interested in embedding FBX to STL functionality in your .NET, Java or Python application, you can consider using the Aspose.3D APIs for this purpose.
