## About GLB to STL

GLB is a popular 3D binary file format that represents 3D models in the GL Transmission format i.e. ([glTF](/3d/gltf/)). STL, abbreviation for stereolithrography, is an interchangeable file format that represents 3-dimensional surface geometry. GLB to STL is a widely used operation for converting GLB files to STL file format. There are many apps available online that can be used for conversion of [GLB](/3d/glb/) to [STL](/cad/stl/) for FREE. If you are an application developer who would like to add the functionality of GLB to STL in his .NET or Java, you can use the Aspose.3D API to achive this.
