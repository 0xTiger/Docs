## About FBX to PLY

FBX, commonly known as FilmBox, is a widely adopted 3D file format originally developed by Kaydara to improve compatibility with MotionBuilder. In 2006, Autodesk Inc. assumed control of this format, cementing its role as a crucial standard for seamlessly exchanging 3D data across various 3D software applications.

PLY, short for Polygon File Format, is a 3D file format designed to store graphical objects defined by a collection of polygons. Its primary objective was to create a straightforward and versatile file format suitable for a broad spectrum of models. PLY files are available in both ASCII and Binary formats, with the latter being ideal for efficient storage and quick retrieval.
