## About 3DS to STL

The .3ds file extension is indicative of the 3D Studio (DOS) mesh file format utilized by Autodesk's 3D Studio software. Autodesk 3D Studio has held a significant presence in the realm of 3D file formats since the 1990s and has subsequently evolved into 3D Studio MAX. [STL](/cad/stl/), short for stereolithography, serves as a versatile file format for depicting three-dimensional surface geometry.

It is a common requirement to convert [3DS](/3d/3ds/) to STL file format and several apps are available online that can convert 3DS to STL for FREE. If you are an application developer who is interested in embedding 3DS to STL functionality in your .NET, Java or Python application, you can consider using the Aspose.3D APIs for this purpose.
