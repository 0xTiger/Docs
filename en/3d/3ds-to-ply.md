## About 3DS to PLY

The ".3ds" file extension signifies the 3D Studio (DOS) mesh file format used by Autodesk's 3D Studio, a pivotal software in 3D file formats since the 1990s, now known as 3D Studio MAX.

PLY, short for Polygon File Format, stores 3D objects as polygons. It's versatile, with both ASCII and Binary formats, the latter being efficient for storage and retrieval.

Converting [3DS](/3d/3ds/) to [PLY](/3d/ply/) is a frequent need, allowing you to change 3DS files into PLY format. Many free online tools are available for this conversion, offering the advantage of accessibility through a web browser without requiring explicit installation. Aspose.3D is one such tool that you can try for free.
