**U3D** (Universal 3D) is a compressed file format and data structure for 3D computer graphics. It contains 3D model information such as triangle meshes, lighting, shading, motion data, lines and points with color and structure. The format was accepted as[ ECMA-363](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-363.htm) standard in August 2005. 3D [PDF](/pdf/) documents support U3D objects embedding and can be viewed in Adobe Reader (version 7 and onwards). U3D format was developed keeping in view the aim to establish a universal standard for three-dimensional data storage and exchange. However, the format finds its main utilization in encoding for 3D PDF rather than being used as an interchange format. Acrobat 3D converts a supported 3D file type to either U3D or PRC upon conversion into the PDF.

## U3D Specifications ##

U3D underwent four editions as described by the ECMA-363 reference document, resulting in specifications update with each edition. The PDF file standard ISO-32000 accepts U3D as allowed annotation and multimedia type. The first edition of U3D was focused on the key representations of 3D graphics properties such as geometry, color, textures, lighting, bones and transform-based animation. The second and third editions corrected some errata in the first edition, with third version being the most commonly used type in industry software. The fourth edition provides definitions for higher-order primitives (curved surfaces). [U3D specifications](http://www.ecma-international.org/publications/standards/Ecma-363.htm) are available online for user reference on ECMA website.
