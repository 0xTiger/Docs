## About 3DS to GLTF

The .3ds file extension indicates the 3D Studio (DOS) mesh file format utilized by Autodesk's 3D Studio software. Autodesk 3D Studio has held a significant position in the 3D file format landscape since the 1990s and has subsequently evolved into 3D Studio MAX.

glTF, or GL Transmission Format, is a 3D file format that uses JSON notation to encapsulate 3D model data. This JSON-based approach efficiently reduces the size of 3D assets and minimizes the computational resources needed for extraction and real-time use.

Converting [3DS](/3d/gltf/) to the [GLTF file format](/3d/gltf/) is a frequent need, and numerous online tools offer free 3DS to GLTF conversion. If you're an application developer looking to integrate 3DS to GLTF functionality into your .NET, Java, or Python application, you may want to explore the Aspose.3D APIs for this task.
