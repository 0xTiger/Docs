## About FBX to USDZ

FBX, short for FilmBox, stands as a widely embraced 3D file format initially crafted by Kaydara for MotionBuilder. Autodesk Inc. assumed ownership in 2006, cementing its status as a primary 3D data exchange format utilized by a multitude of 3D software tools.

A file bearing the .usdz extension represents an uncompressed and unencrypted ZIP archive tailored for the [USD](/3d/usd/) (Universal Scene Description) file format. It houses proxies for various file types, including textures and animations, all conveniently encapsulated within the archive.
