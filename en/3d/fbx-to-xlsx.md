## About FBX to XLSX

FilmBox, frequently known as FBX, is a widely used 3D file format that was initially created by Kaydara to enhance compatibility with MotionBuilder. In 2006, Autodesk Inc. took the reins of this format, solidifying its status as a standard for effortlessly exchanging 3D data across various 3D software applications.

**XLSX** is a widely recognized format for Microsoft Excel documents introduced by Microsoft alongside the release of Microsoft Office 2007. It adheres to a structured organization based on the Open Packaging Conventions, as detailed in [Part 2](https://ecma-international.org/publications-and-standards/standards/ecma-376/) of the ECMA-376 OOXML standard. This new format is essentially a zip package containing multiple XML files.
