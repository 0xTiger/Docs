A JRXML file is created by JasperReports and contains design definition in popular [XML](/web/xml/) file format. It stores all the design elements such as report layout, text fields, images, charts, parameters, and variables. JasperReports is a Java library used for creating reports programmatically by retrieving data from backend databases and storage media.
