## About FBX to 3DS

FilmBox, commonly referred to as FBX, is a widely adopted 3D file format originally developed by Kaydara to facilitate compatibility with MotionBuilder. Autodesk Inc. assumed control of this format in 2006, establishing it as a key standard for the seamless exchange of 3D data among diverse 3D software applications. 

A file bearing the [.3ds extension](/3d/3ds/) signifies the 3D Studio (DOS) mesh file format employed by Autodesk's 3D Studio software. Autodesk's presence in the 3D file format arena dates back to the 1990s and has since evolved into 3D Studio MAX, a comprehensive tool for 3D modeling, animation, and rendering. The .3ds file encapsulates data for the three-dimensional depiction of scenes and images, making it one of the favored file formats for importing and exporting 3D data.
