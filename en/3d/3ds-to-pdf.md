## About 3DS to PDF

The ".3ds" file extension serves as a marker for the 3D Studio (DOS) mesh file format, which was utilized by Autodesk's 3D Studio software. Since the 1990s, Autodesk's 3D Studio has been a significant player in the realm of 3D file formats and has evolved into the robust software now recognized as 3D Studio MAX.

PDF, created by Adobe in the 1990s, is a universal document format. It's platform-independent and can include text, images, links, forms, multimedia, digital signatures, and more.

3DS files are often converted to [PDF file format](/pdf/) that contains the 3D features of the file in 3D.
