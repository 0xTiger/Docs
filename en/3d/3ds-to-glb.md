## About 3DS to GLB

The ".3ds" file extension serves as a marker for the 3D mesh file format originally associated with Autodesk's 3D Studio (DOS) software. Autodesk's 3D Studio has been a significant player in the realm of 3D file formats since the 1990s and has evolved into the robust software known as 3D Studio MAX.

The [GLB file format](/3d/glb/) is a 3D format that consolidates models, textures, and animations into a unified binary file. It excels in the efficient distribution and rapid loading of 3D content within applications and on the internet, with a special emphasis on AR, VR, and web-based 3D experiences.

People frequently require 3DS to GLB file conversions, and there are many free online tools for this. If you're a software developer looking to add 3DS to GLB conversion to your .NET, Java, or Python app, consider using Aspose.3D APIs for a convenient solution.
