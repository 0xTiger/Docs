## About 3DS to DAE

The file extension ".3ds" is an identifier of the mesh file format known as 3D Studio (DOS), which is employed by Autodesk's 3D Studio software. Autodesk's 3D Studio has played a prominent role in the world of 3D file formats since the 1990s and has since transformed into the powerful software known as 3D Studio MAX.

A [DAE file](/3d/dae/), abbreviated from Digital Asset Exchange file, functions as a format designed for the exchange of data between interactive 3D applications. It utilizes the COLLADA (COLLAborative Design Activity) XML schema, which serves as an open standard for sharing digital assets across a variety of graphics software applications.

Many people often need to convert [3DS](/3d/3ds/) files to the DAE format, and numerous online tools provide free 3DS to DAE conversion services. If you happen to be a software developer interested in incorporating 3DS to DAE conversion capabilities into your .NET, Java, or Python application, you may discover that the Aspose.3D APIs are a valuable solution for achieving this task.
