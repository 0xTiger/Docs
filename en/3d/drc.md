## What is a DRC file?

A file with .drc extension is a compressed 3D file format created with Google Draco library. Google offers Draco as open source library for compressing and decompressing 3D geometric meshes and point clouds, and improves storage and transmission of 3D graphics. It encodes the input data and saves it as .drc file. At the receiving end, the API reads .drc files and can output these as [PLY](/3d/ply/) or [OBJ](/3d/obj/) files. The compressed output file enables users to download apps faster and provide quick loading of 3D graphics in browsers.

## DRC File Format

File format details for DRC are not available publicly. Google has hosted the Draco library on [GitHub](https://github.com/google/draco/tree/master/docs) for developer's reference. It provides encoders and decoders for creating and converting DRC files.
