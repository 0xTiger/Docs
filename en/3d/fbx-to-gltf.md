## About FBX to GLTF

FilmBox, commonly known as FBX, stands as a widely adopted 3D file format initially crafted by Kaydara to complement MotionBuilder. In 2006, Autodesk Inc. took the helm, propelling FBX into a prominent position as a primary 3D data exchange format embraced by a multitude of 3D software tools.

glTF, short for GL Transmission Format, serves as a 3D file format designed to encapsulate 3D model data within JSON notation. This implementation with JSON serves to efficiently reduce the dimensions of 3D assets, as well as diminish the computational overhead required for their extraction and utilization during runtime.

It is a common requirement to convert [FBX](/3d/fbx/) to GLTF file format and several apps are available online that can convert FBX to GLTF for FREE. If you are an application developer who is interested in embedding FBX to GLTF functionality in your .NET, Java or Python application, you can consider using the Aspose.3D APIs for this purpose.
