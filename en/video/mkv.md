## What Are MKV Files? ##

MKV (Matroska Video) is a multimedia container similar to [MOV](/video/mov/) and [AVI](/video/avi/) format but it supports more than one audio and subtitle tracks in the same file. An MKV file is the Matroska multimedia container format used for video. MKV is based on Extensible Binary Meta Language and it supports several video and audio compression formats. The major difference between MKV and other video formats is that MKV is a container and not a codec. MKV files are saved with the .mkv file extension. MKV can incorporate audio, video, and subtitles in a single file even if those elements use different types of encoding. For example, you could have an MKV file that contains H.264 video and MP3 or AAC for audio. MKV also supports descriptions, ratings, cover art, and even chapter points. There are several key features that MKV future proof. These features include:

- Support for Fast seeking.
- Ability to select different audio and video streams.
- Support for subtitles(hard-coded and soft-coded).
- Support for metadata, chapters, and menus.
- Capability to stream online.
- Ability to recover erroneous files that provide the capability to play corrupted files.

## Brief History ##

MKV file originated in 2002 in Russia. The lead developer was Lasse Kärkkäinen who worked with the founder of Matroska, Steve Lhomme, and a team of programmers. MKV was developed as an open standards project, which means that it is open source and free to use. As time went on, the format was improved and became the basis of WebM multimedia format in 2010.

## How to Play MKV Files ##

Even though the support for the MKV format has grown rapidly, it is still not an industry standard and not all media players support it. There are two options to play MKV files, downloading a compatible media player, or downloading the codecs for the media player of your preference.

### Compatible video players ###

While the MKV video format is not as common as the MP4, [MOV](/video/mov/), and [AVI](/video/avi/) formats, many media players still support opening and playing MKV files, including:

- VLC
- MPlayer
- KMPlayer
- DivX Player
- MKV File Player
- The Core Media Player

### Using Codecs ###

If you do not want a new media player and prefer to use your existing player, you will need to install some codecs(shorthand for compression/decompression). Even though downloading codecs is a valid option, you should be careful about the source and these may contain malware.
