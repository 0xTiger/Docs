## What is a AEP file?

An AEP file is a project file created by Adobe After Effects when you save an After Effect project. It is the main file type used by After Effects to save all the settings and data related to the project such as video footage, still images, audio files, and any other effects. AEP file contains information about the composition, layers, keyframes, effects, and other elements that are part of the After Effects project.

You can open AEP files with Adobe After Effects software.

## AEP File Format - More Information

Adobe After Effect stores AEP file in binary file format. The internal file structure of AEP file is not available publicly for developer's reference and, that is why, these can only be opened in Adobe After Effect. AEP file stores references to the elements that are part of the project but does not actually contain these collections and elements. If you move the reference files after the project is created, After Effects will not be able to locate the files and you will not be able to use these media files.

### Types of After Effects Project Files

After Effects saves project files in:

 * `AEP File` - This is stored in binary format and has a small size. Binary files load quicker and can be shared with other users easily.
 * `AEPX File` - This is XML based After Effects project file format that stores data in text format. AEPX files are usually larger and slower to load than the AEP file format.

## How to Convert AEP File

AEP files can be converted to other popular file formats such as:

 * [.MOV](/video/mov/) - Apple QuickTime Movie
 * [.AVI](/video/avi/) - Audio Video Interleave
 * [.JPG](/image/jpeg/) - JPEG Image
 * [.PNG](/image/png/) - Portable Network Graphic
 * .DPX - Digital Picture Exchange
 * .EXR - OpenEXR Image
 * .M4A - MPEG-4 Audio
 * [.MP3](/audio/mp3/) - MP3 Audio
 * [.WAV](/audio/wav/) - WAVE Audio
 * .AEPX - After Effects XML Project
 * .AET - After Effects Template
 * .PRPROJ - Adobe Premiere Pro
