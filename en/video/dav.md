## What is a DAV file?

A DAV file is a compressed and encrypted video file created by DVR365 or Dahua Technology's digital surveillance system. These systems connected to a closed-circuit television (CCTV) camera surveillance system. The footage videos received from these camera is store as DAV file in the system. Since DAV files are encrypted, only the CCTV system that created them or some specialized media players can open them. DAV files can also be converted to [AVI](/video/avi/) file format.

## DAV File Format - More Information

DAV files are stored to disc in encrypted binary file format. Encryption prevents the unauthorized use of these files. Thus, these are proprietary to the the CCTV systems by [Dahua Technology](https://www.dahuasecurity.com/). Some other cameras from Dahua Technologies may also save the surveillance video as DAV files.

Dahua Smart Player can be used to open and play DAV files.
