## What is a PZ file?

A PZ file is a project file created with the online video clips making application **Panzoid**. It contains information about the video project and its contents such as scene, objects, effects, lighting, FX, audio and music. Panzoid allows you to create videos online using their **ClipMaker** video editing facility.

PZ files can be opened with Panzoid ClipMaker and Panzoid Backgrounder.

## PZ File Format

PZ files are saved as binary files to disc. When a user creates a new project with [Panzoid](https://panzoid.com/), a PZ file is created that keeps the details of user defined objects saved. The same information is synched with other users if the project is other contributors. PZ files can then be downloaded to the computer.

When you want to open PZ file, you can again load it in **Panzoid** by using the Load option from online interface. The file is loaded online and its contents are loaded for modifications.

### Supported Video Clips by PZ File
