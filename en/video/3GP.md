## What is a 3GP file? ##

3GP(3GPP File Format) is a multimedia container format that can be used on 3G mobile phones. It can also be played on some 2G and 4G phones. 3GP is defined by the Third Generation Partnership Project (3GPP) for 3G UMTS (Universal Mobile Telecommunications System) multimedia services. 3GP files are stored with the .3gp extension. 3GP file format was designed for GSM-based (Global System for Mobile Communications) phones and is the standard format for media files sent via MMS (Multimedia Messaging Service).

## Technical Details ##

The 3GP format is based on the ISO base media file format defined in ISO/IEC 14496-12 â€“ MPEG-4 Part 12. 3GP file format was developed for mobile phones to reduce storage, bandwidth, and data usage. 3GP file format supports the following codecs:

- Video

  - AAC-LC
