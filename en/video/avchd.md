## What is an AVCHD file? ##
The AVCHD file is a recording file format introduced for saving high-definition(HD) videos to DVDs, hard disk drives, and memory cards. The AVCHD file format allows the high-definition digital video cameras to record an HD signal; using high-efficiency compression coding technology. To compress video; the [MPEG-4](/video/mp4/) AVC/[H.264](/video/h264/) format has been adopted, and the Dolby Digital® is used to compress the audio data. Whereas, The MPEG-4 AVC/H.264 format is more efficient than the conventional image compressing format. Moreover, the 3D (MVC format) and 1080/60p(1080/50p) video formats have been added as an extension to the AVCHD file format for its version 2.0 (AVCHD 3D, AVCHD Progressive) format. 

Please note that a device must be compatible with AVCHD V. 2.0 to handle AVCHD V. 2.0 related videos.
