## What is an AVCHD file? ##
The AVCHD file is a recording file format introduced for saving high-definition(HD) videos to DVDs, hard disk drives, and memory cards. AVCHD videos, recorded onto DVD and Blu-ray can be played on easily on most Blu-ray Disc players. Also, the AVCHD stuff can also be recorded on SD cards and played by many Blu-ray Disc players, television sets and media consoles. The **ffdshow tryouts** and **Libavcodec** are the open source codecs which can decode the AVCHD files.


## AVCHD file format
The AVCHD file format allows the high-definition digital video cameras to record an HD signal; using high-efficiency compression coding technology. To compress video; the [MPEG-4](/video/mp4/) AVC/[H.264](/video/h264/) format has been adopted, and the Dolby Digital® is used to compress the audio data. Whereas, The MPEG-4 AVC/H.264 format is more efficient than the conventional image compressing format. Moreover, the 3D (MVC format) and 1080/60p(1080/50p) video formats have been added as an extension to the AVCHD file format for its version 2.0 (AVCHD 3D, AVCHD Progressive) format. 
Please note that a device must be compatible with AVCHD V. 2.0 to handle AVCHD V. 2.0 related videos.

## Comparison between AVCHD and MP4 file formats ##
The Advanced Video Codec High Definition (AVCHD) file format is well suited for creating Blu-ray Disc® recordings and watching on an HDTV. Whereas, MP4 is much easier to play on portable devices and also simple in moving, copying and saving on the web.

Differences for both formats are given in the table below.
