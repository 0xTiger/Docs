MPV files do not contain any audio data. The MPV file format is also used as input to video processing applications as the [MPEG](/video/mpg/) elementary stream use the MPEG-2 encoding standards primarily. MPV files can be opened and played with software applications that support MPEG-2 video file formats. VideoLAN LVC media player software is one such software that can open and play MPV files.
