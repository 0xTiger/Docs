An image file format is a standard method for organizing and storing images on devices like computers, tablets and smartphones. Digital images store image data in 2-dimensional grid of pixels where each pixel is a representation of colour in terms of number of bits. Image file types are classified into vector image formats and raster image formats. 3D Images are another type of vector image file format that is used for managing 3D images.

## Raster Formats ##

**Raster Graphics** are digital images that comprise of pixels data for representation of colours. These are the most common image types for graphics used for web as well as digital photos. Some of the raster images can be compressed to reduce image file size. Common raster image file extensions and their file formats include **[BMP](/image/bmp/)** (Bitmap image file), **[PNG](/image/png/)** (Portable Network Graphics) and **[GIF](/image/gif/)** (Graphics Interchange File). 

## Vector Formats ##

**Vector images** are defined by 2D points, instead of pixels, which are connected to give a geometric shape to the image. The points have properties that define the direction of paths, color, shape, curve, thickness, and fill. Common vector image file extensions and their file formats include **[SVG](/page-description-language/svg/)** (Scalable Vector Graphics), **[EPS](/page-description-language/eps/)** (Encapsulated PostScript language) and **[PDF](/pdf/)** (Portable Document Format).
