## What is a JXL file?

JXL stands for JPEG XL. It is an image file that is saved in JPEG XL file format. It supports both lossy as well as lossless compression. JXL is extended version of the JPEG XL file format that was developed by the Joint Photographic Experts Group (JPEG). It can contain an image, illustrations, or screenshot that has been compressed using the JPEG XL compression algorithm.

### Brief History of JXL File Format

 * Aug 2017 - Call for proposals for JPEG XL as next generation image encoding standard
 * Sep 2018 - Proposals submission
 * July 2019 - Combination of PIK proposal submitted by Google and FUIF proposal submitted by Cloudinary
 * Dec 2020 - Informal freezing of bitstream
 * Oct 2021 - Standardization of the File Format and core coding system

## JXL File Format

JXL files are saved as binary files and can be opened in Windows by double clicking the image. The JXL file format provides improved functionality and efficiency as compared to other image file formats such as JPEG, GIF and PNG. The main rivals of JXL file format include AVIF and WebP that both focus on compressing the image size.

## JXL Standardization

 * Part 1	- 30 March 2022	- [ISO/IEC 18181-1](https://www.iso.org/standard/77977.html) - Core Coding System
 * Part 2	- 13 October 2021	- [ISO/IEC 18181-2](https://www.iso.org/standard/80617.html) - File Format
 * Part 3	- 3 October 2022	- [ISO/IEC 18181-3](https://www.iso.org/standard/80618.html) - Conformance Testing
 * Part 4	- 5 August 2022	- [ISO/IEC 18181-4](https://www.iso.org/standard/80619.html) - Reference Software

## How to Convert JXL

JXL files can be converted to a number of other image file formats such as:

 * [.JPEG](/image/jpeg/) - JPEG Image
 * [.GIF ](/image/gif/) - Graphical Interchange Format
 * [.PNG](/image/png/) - Portable Network Graphic
 * [.TIFF](/image/tiff/) - Tagged Image File Format
 * [.BMP](/image/bmp/) - Bitmap Image
 * [.PCX](/image/pcx/) - Paintbrush Bitmap Image
 * [.TGA](/image/tga/) - Targa Graphic
 * [.JPX](/image/jpx/) - JPEG 2000 Image
 * [.JXR](/image/jxr/) - JPEG XR Image
 * [.WEBP](/image/webp/) - WebP Image
