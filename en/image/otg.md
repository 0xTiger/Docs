An OTG file is a drawing template that is created using the OpenDocument standard that follows the OASIS Office Applications [1.0 specification](http://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/12572/OpenDocument-v1.0-os.pdf). It represents the default organization of drawing elements for a vector image that can be used to further enhance the contents of the file.
