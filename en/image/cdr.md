A CDR file is a vector drawing image file that is natively created with [CorelDRAW](https://www.coreldraw.com/en/pages/open-cdr-file/)Â for storing digital image encoded and compressed. Such a drawing file contains text, lines, shapes, images, colours and effects for vector representation of image contents. CDR files can be opened with CorelDRAW as the primary application and can also be converted to other formats such as [PDF](/pdf/), [JPG](/image/jpeg/), [PNG](/image/png/), [BMP](/image/bmp/) and AI. It can be used for representation of various graphics data like brochures, tabloids, envelopes, and postcards. Besides CorelDRAW, other Corel products such as Corel Paintshop Pro and CorelDRAW Graphics suite can also open the CDR file formats.
