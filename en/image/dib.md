A DIB (Device Independent Bitmap) file is a raster imageÂ file that is similar in structure to the standard Bitmap files ([BMP](/image/bmp/)) but has a different header. It can be opened with almost all applications that can open a standard BMP file on Windows as well as macOS. DIB are binary files and have a complex file format similar to BMP.
