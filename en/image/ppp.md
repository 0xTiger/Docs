## What is a PPP file?

A PPP file is a graphics project file created with NCH PhotoPad Editor Software. It comprises of the edited image in PhotoPad along with the record of all the edits made to different components (such as layers, text, adjustments) of that image. This lets you revert to a previous editing stage and start editing from that point. PPP Project files can be opened in PhotoPad software and can be exported to popular image file formats such as [JPG](/image/jpeg/), [PNG](/image/png/), [TIFF](/image/tiff/), [GIF](/image/gif/), and [PSD](/image/psd/).

### PPP File Format

PPP files are saved to disc as binary files with contents of the file arranged inside as layers. Each PPP file can contain multiple image components (raster data, text, adjustments) in the form of layers that can be edited individually when the file is opened in PhotoPad editor. Edits made to an image inside PhotoPad do not effect the original image and user can revert to any previously saved edit to start again. The record of all these edits lie inside the PPP file.

Once open, PhotoPad Editor lets you manipulate the image in a number of ways with operations such as crop, rotate, resize and flip. It lets you improve the photo quality and focus with blur, sharpness and noise reduction. It also lets you apply photo effects, including oil paint, cartoon, vignette, sepia and many more.
