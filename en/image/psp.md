## What is a PSP file?

A PSP file is a colored bitmap image created with PaintShop Pro. It is the native file format of PaintShop Pro and supports uncompressed, RLE compressed, LZ77 compressed, and [JPEG](/image/jpeg/) compressed files (including Lossless JPEG). It also supports layers similar to [PSD](/image/psd/) files and can have other information such as guides, metadata, and relevant objects within the image file. Each layer can be edited and integrated with the main image by its own. PSP files can be opened with PaintShop Pro software.

## PSP File Format

PSP files are saved to disc as binary files with support of different compression algorithms. The bits per pixel information can be stored in a PSP file with the following option.

 * 1 (gray)
 * 4 (gray)
 * 8 (gray or color)
 * 24 (color)

PSP files can be saved on both x32 and x64 operating systems. [PSPIMAGE](/image/pspimage/) is another file format used by PaintShop Pro.
