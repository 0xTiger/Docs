## What is a PSPIMAGE file?

A PSPIMAGE file is a graphics image saved using Corel PaintShop Pro software that is used for image and digital photo editing. It supports saving image data in both raster and vector file formats. PSPIMAGE files support edits made to an image such as layers, transparency, filters and other image effects. PSPIMAGE files can be saved and exported to other popular image file formats such as [JPEG](/image/jpeg/), [PNG](/), and [BMP](/image/bmp/).

## PSPIMAGE File Format

PSPIMAGE files are saved to disc as binary files and their data can only be analyzed in a HEX editor. It is the native file format of PaintShop Pro and was introduced with the version 8 of the software. Before PSPIMAGE format, PaintShop Pro saved images in the PSP file format.

PSPIMAGE files can be created as new File from within PaintShop Pro. Due to the support of layers functionality, the file format lets you edit images and store them to disc.
