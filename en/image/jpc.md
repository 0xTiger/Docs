## What is a JPC file?

A JPC file is an image file format that is encoded using the [JPEG2000](/image/jp2/) code stream. These are also sometimes referred as Japan Picture files. JPC files uses JPEG 2000 advanced wavelet compression that is also used by the JPEG2000 encoded files. These support color depths of 8, 24, and 32 bits per pixel in the grayscale, RGB, YCbCr, XYZ, and Lab colro spaces.

JPC files can be opened with Adobe Photoshop 2022, Adobe Photoshop Elements, and Adobe Illustrator 2021.
