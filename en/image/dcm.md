Files with .DCM extension represent digital image which stores medical information of patients such as MRIs, CT scans and ultrasound images. It was developed by the [National Electrical Manufacturers Association](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Electrical_Manufacturers_Association) (NEMA) and was meant to standardize the imaging file format for distribution and viewing of medical images. It is similar to DICOM file format and can include patientâ€™s information for reference.
