## Visio File Formats ##

From 2013 visio has introduced a new file format .vsdx which is the replacement of two other file formats known as .vsd (Visio binary file format) and .vdx (Visio XML Drawing file format). .vsdx has increased the interoperability of the Visio files because now third-party software can also manipulate Visio files at a file format level. The new file format is supported on Visio Services in Microsoft SharePoint Server, and does not need any "intermediary" file format for publishing to SharePoint Server. There are several file types that comprise the visio with following extensions:

* .vsdx (Visio drawing)
* .vsdm (Visio macro-enabled drawing)
* .vssx (Visio stencil)
* .vssm (Visio macro-enabled stencil)
* .vstx (Visio template)
* .vstm (Visio macro-enabled template)
