## What is a DCX file?

A DCX file is an image file that consists of multiple-pages for generating digital fax files. Each DCX file starts with a 4-byte header identifying the DCX file as signature, followed by individual images, stored as embedded [PCX](/image/pcx/) files. The 4-byte signature identifies the DCX file and it is followed by a list of up to 1023 4-byte file offsets. DCX file format was developed by Zsoft. Several applications can open DCX files such as Adobe Photoshop, Corel PaintShop Pro, and IrfanView.
