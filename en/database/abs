## What is an ABS file?

A file with .abs extension is a database generated and used by Absolute database which is a database engine for the Delphi software development IDE. It replaced the Borland Database Engine (DBE)  and is more compact, high-speed, robust and easy-to-use. ABS database compiles as part of the application EXE file, making your application faster and smaller. Data is stored in an ABS file in a structured, relational format.

## ABS File Format - More Information

ABS files are strored as part of the application's [EXE file](/executable/exe/) which is usually stored as a binary file. Binary files can not be opened in any text editor and provide fast access to the contents of the database file.
