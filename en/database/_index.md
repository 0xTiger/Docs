A database is a collection of data that is organized in tables and maintained on a computer storage device and accessed electronically. Relational databases store data in database tables that are linked to each other via formal design and modeling techniques. Data in a database is analyzed using Database Management System (DBMS) that is the main source of interaction with end users, applications and the database itself.

Popular database file extensions and their file formats include **SQLite**, **DB**, **ACCDB**, and **MDB**.
