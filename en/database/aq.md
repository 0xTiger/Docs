## What is an AQ file?

A file with .aq extension is a database file created with Ancestral Quest application by Incline Software, LC. It stores family tree information using the genealogical data entered by individuals using the free and premium version of the software. The database stores information such as the names, birthplaces, and relationships of family members. Ancestral Quest uses this information for linking and classifying information such as Pedigree, Descendants, Family and Timeline view. AQ files can be opened using the [Incline Software Ancestral Quest](https://www.ancquest.com/index.htm).
