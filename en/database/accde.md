## What is an ACCDE file?

A file with .accde extension is a Microsoft Access 2007 file format for creating Execute Only database files to protect custom database code. It compiles all VBA code into executable only so that it cannot be viewed or edited. ACCDE file format is replacement fo MDE file format that was used by earlier versions of Microsoft Access. ACCDE are [ACCDB](/database/accdb/) files in executable only mode and more compact due to absence of any source code. The compact size of these files improves the memory usage as well as enhances the application performance. ACCDE files can be opened with Microsoft Access 365.

## ACCDE File Format

All Microsoft Access 2007+ files utilize the Jet ACE (Access database engine) that uses the ACCDB file format family. However, Microsoft does not provide an open source implementation or a detailed technical specification.
