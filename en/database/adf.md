## What is an ADF file?

A file with .adf extension is a database file created with ACT CRM (Customer Relationship Management) software to store relationship data about customers. It stores information about customer's name, email, contact, business information, and relationship history. CRM systems are more often integrated with call centres established by businesses to automatically retrieve user information for incoming calls. ADF files can be opened with SwiftPage ACT software on Windows OS.

## ADF File Format - More Information

ADF files are saved to disc as binary files and their internal structure information is not available publicly. Another file with extension .alf is saved along with the ADF files which contains metadata required to navigate, backup, and restore the ACT! database.
