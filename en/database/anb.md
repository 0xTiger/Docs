## What is an ANB file?

A file with .anb extension is IBM i2 Analyst's Notebook chart that contains relationship information between different data. As the name suggests, the Analyst's Notebook software helps in linking the data, resulting in a more concise form of connectivity between difference pieces of information and providing intelligence output for analysis. This helps to identify and disrupt malicious activities such as criminal, cyber, and fraudulent threats. ANB files can be opened with IBM i2Analyst's Notebook software.

## ANB File Format - More Information

An ANB file comprises of the following constituent items:

* Entities - Representation of pieces of Information
* Links - Show the connectivity between Entities
* Properties - Description of an entity or link in more detail

ANB files store all this information based on input information feed into the ANB Analyst's Notebook. Based on the data input, the software creates links between each piece of information that helps to map out relationships and trace evidence geospatially and temporally.
