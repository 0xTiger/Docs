## What is a MDB file?

A file with .mdb extension is a Microsoft Access database file which is a Relational Database Management System (RDBMS). It stores data in database tables that are linked to each other via primary and foreign keys. The MDB file contains complete structure of the database tables, queries, stored procedures. MDB is the default file format for Microsoft Access 2003. The lateral versions of Microsoft Access use the ACCDB file formats which is the latest file format to date. MDB files can be opened with applications like Microsoft Access, MDB Viewer, MDBOpener, and can be converted to ACCDB, CSV, Excel formats, etc.

## MDB File Format

There are public specifications available for MDB format and it remains Microsoft's proprietary file format. Microsoft, however, provides connectivity access to the MDB file using Open Database Connectivity (ODBC) standard and Visual Basic for Applications (VBA). The unofficial MDB guide provides brief informal description of the MDB format based on the reverse engineering and can be consulted for knowing about the specifications.
