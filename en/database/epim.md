## What is an EPIM file?

The .epim file extension is used by EssentialPIM, a personal information manager software that allows users to organize and manage their contacts, appointments, tasks, and notes. The .epim file is a database file that stores all the data entered into the program, including personal information, calendar events, and task lists. This file can be backed up, exported and imported to another EssentialPIM installation. The software is available for Windows, Android, and iOS platforms.

The .epim files are the proprietary format used by EssentialPIM. It is important to note that .epim files are specific to EssentialPIM software and cannot be opened or edited with other software.

## How to create EPIM file?

To create an .epim file in EssentialPIM, you will need to first have the software installed on your computer.

1. Open EssentialPIM.
2. Click on the "File" menu and select "New Database."
3. A dialog box will appear, asking you to select the location and name of the new database file.
4. Enter a name and choose a location for the file, and then click "Save."
5. The new database file will be created with the .epim file extension and you can start adding data such as contacts, appointments, tasks, and notes.

Alternatively, you can also use "File" -> "Import" to import data from various formats and create a new .epim file. Besides, if you already have a database file and you want to create a new one from it, you can use the "File" -> "Export" option to export all the data from the current .epim file and import it to the new one.

## Location of EPIM files

The location of .epim files in EssentialPIM depends on the operating system you are using.

- On Windows, the default location for .epim files is in the "My Documents" folder, but you can choose a different location when you create a new database file.
- On Android, the default location for .epim files is in the "Download" folder, but you can choose a different location when you create a new database file.
- On iOS, the default location for .epim files is in the "EssentialPIM" folder, but you can choose a different location when you create a new database file.

You can also use the "File" -> "Open Database" option to open an existing .epim file from a different location on your computer or device.
