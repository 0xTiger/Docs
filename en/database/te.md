## What is a TE file?

A TE file is a database file created with the education application Textease that is based on Information and Communications Technology (ICT). It contains data that is stored inside multiple fields including forms, text, images, and other data. Textease Studio CT is no more developed and support for TE files is no longer available. TE files can be opened with Lightbox Education Textease Studio CT software.

## TE File Format

The internal file format of TE files is unknown. Textease provided single as well as multiple user based licenses for working with the software. In case of multi-user database, a .mud file is also generated and saved along with the TE file. TE files can be accessed by multiple users from any computers with access to the network. This allows multiple users to work on the same TE database file from anywhere in the world.

## TE Field Types

 * Text
 * Number
 * [Image](/image/)
 * Colour
 * Date (DD/MM/YYYY)
 * Currency
