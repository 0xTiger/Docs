## What is a DT2 file?

A DT2 file is an elevation file that represents Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED) file. It contains elevation data in uniformly spaced patterns. The elevation data can be read by GIS software programs and finds its applications in different areas such as military, scientific, and other communities.

GIS applications that can open DT2 files include ESRI ArcGIS Pro, TatukGIS, Blue Marble Geographic Global Mapper, and Pitney Bowes MapInfo. Other variants of DTED file types are [DT0](/gis/dt0/) and [DT1](/gis/dt1/). 

### DT2 File Format

DT2 files are save as binary files to disc and can be read using many GIS applications. These can be merged into a File Geodatabase Raster Catalog that can be used to create one big mosaic.
