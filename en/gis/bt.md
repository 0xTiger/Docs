## What is an BT file?

Binary Terrain (BT) is a GIS file format used to store digital elevation data of a terrain. It is a binary file format that stores data in a compact and efficient way. BT file format is used to store large amounts of elevation data that can be used in a variety of applications such as GIS, video games, simulations, and other applications that require detailed terrain information. The data stored in a BT file typically includes the elevation of each point on the terrain, as well as other information such as the slope and aspect of the terrain.

## BT File Format - More Information

BT files are saved to disc in binary file format which is not human readable. The BT format is designed to be compact, fast to read and write, and easy to use with a variety of software applications.

### How to Open BT file?

You can use GIS software applications like QGIS, ArcGIS, and Global Mapper to open a BT file. Once opened, you can then view and analyze the terrain information inside the BT file.
