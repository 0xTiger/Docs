## What is an NM2 file?

A file with .nm2 extension is a map file created with Navitel navigation system. It stores geospatial data related to different map entities such as roads, streets, road lanes, point on the map, landmarks and other GPS data. NM2 files can be opened using Navitel software on different type of devices such as Android phones, iOS devices, Windows Phone, and Symbian devices. These apps are freely available and can be downloaded and installed on respective devices.

## NM2 File Format - More Information

NM2 files are saved as binary files and their internal file format/data structure is not available publicly. The recent versions of Navitel save the data as .nm7 files. There are several map files available by Navitel on their [website](https://www.navitel.cz/en/downloads/demo). The [Navitel documentation](https://www.navitel.cz/en/downloads/documentation) provides complete user guides about using its navigation system for different type of devices and vehicles.
