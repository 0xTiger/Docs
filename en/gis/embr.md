## What is an EMBR file?

An EMBR file is a GIS file that was developed and used by the GEOREID Pty Ltd. It contains geospatial data such as calculated length and volumes at any specific point. EMBR file format stores this statistical data in plain text format that can be opened in a text editor for viewing and editing. GIS systems store geological information with reference to any lat-long point which represents the absolution position on earth.

Other popular GIS file formats used to store geospatial data include [gpx](/gis/gpx/), [geojson](/gis/geojson/), [kml](/gis/kml/), and [kmz](/gis/kmz/).
