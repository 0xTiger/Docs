## What is a DIX file?

A DIX file is a proprietary file format created with DIVA-GIS geographic data analysis program. It consists of a DIVA-GIS project (.div) file and other GIS data layers referenced by the project. DIX files can be exported from within DIVA-GIS and can be shared with other users who can import these into DIVA. You can also use DIX files to store all the relevant files related to a project in one location.

## DIX File Format

A DIX file is stored to disk as a compressed binary file. Due to compression, DIX files do not take up much disk space and can be sent to other users via email. A DIX file can contain both raster and vector data, and they can also store attribute tables, metadata, and other data associated with the spatial data.
