## What is an ETA file?

A file with .eta extension is a Google Earth Placemark file that is created with Google Earth software. It contains bookmarks/marker information for a location in the world using parameters such as latitude, longitude, rotation, zoom, and title. This enables users to have a bird-eye view of the location. With the introduction of the new file formats i.e. [.kml](/gis/kml/) and [.kmz](/gis/kmz/), the ETA file format was phased out and was replaced with these new file formats. ETA files can be opened in [Google Earth](https://earth.google.com/web/) software that is available for download free of cost.
