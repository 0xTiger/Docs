## What is a DT1 file?

A DT1 file is a Digital Terrain Elevation Data (DTED) file that contains terrain data uniformly spaced. It is mainly used by military GIS software applications to get elevation, slope, and surface contour data. DT1 file is similar to [DT0](/gis/dt0/) and [DT2](/gis/dt2/) but with medium granularity of information.

DT1 files can be opened with GIS applications such as ESRI ArcGIS Pro, TatukGIS, Blue Marble Geographic Global Mapper, and Pitney Bowes MapInfo.

### DT1 File Format

DT1 files are save as binary files to disc and can be read using many GIS applications. These can be merged into a File Geodatabase Raster Catalog that can be used to create one big mosaic.
