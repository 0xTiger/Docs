## What is an SAF file?

A SAF file is a GIS file format used by the Street Atlas USA map software which allows users to view and navigate street maps of the United States. It is used to store map data such as detailed information about the roads, highways, and points of interest in a specific geographic area. SAF files can be used to plan routes, locate addresses, and perform other tasks related to navigating and exploring the region.

Street Atlas USA map files can be opened and used with the Street Atlas USA software, or they can be converted to other file formats using specialized tools.

## SAF File Format - More Information

Street Atlas USA map files use a proprietary file format called SAF, which stands for Street Atlas File. The internal structure of this file format is not publicly documented, and it is not easily readable or editable without specialized software.

If you need to access the data contained within a Street Atlas USA map file, you will need to use the Street Atlas USA software or a tool specifically designed to read and convert SAF files. Several third-party tools can also convert SAF files to other popular GIS file formats, such as Google Earth's [KML](/gis/kml/) or [GPX](/gis/gpx/) (GPS Exchange Format), which may be more compatible with other software or easier to manipulate. However, the exact capabilities of these tools and the quality of the resulting data may vary.

### How to Convert SAF File?

There are a number of tools available that can convert Street Atlas USA map files (in the SAF format) to other file formats. Here are a few options you can try:

1. **Street Atlas USA software:** If you have a copy of Street Atlas USA installed on your computer, you can use the software's export feature to save the map data in a different file format. To do this, open the map in Street Atlas USA and select the data you want to export. Then, go to the File menu and choose "Export." From the Export dialog, you can choose the file format you want to save the data in, such as KML or GPX.

1. **Third-party conversion tools:** There are several third-party tools available that can convert SAF files to other formats. Some of these tools may be able to import SAF files directly, while others may require you to first export the data from Street Atlas USA in a compatible format, such as a CSV file. Examples of third-party conversion tools include GPSBabel, which can convert SAF files to GPX, and Safe Software's FME, which can convert SAF files to a variety of formats.

1. **Online conversion services:** There are also a number of online services that can convert SAF files to other formats. To use one of these services, you will typically need to upload the SAF file to the service's website and then choose the target file format. Some online conversion services may also allow you to convert SAF files by providing a URL to the file or by dragging and dropping the file onto the page.

The quality and accuracy of the converted data may vary depending on the tool or service you use. Some tools may not support all the features and data contained in a SAF file, or they may introduce errors or inconsistencies during the conversion process.
