## What is an NMC file?

An NMC file is a map package content file created with ESRI ArcGIS Explorer software. It can store various elements of a map such as image overlays, GIS service layers, [KML](/gis/kml/) layers, raster layers, features and other packages. NCM files are used to export maps data that can be used in other GIS maps that are open in ArcGIS Explorer. This lets multiple maps overlayed over each other and displayed.

## NMC File Format

NMC files are saved in binary file format, with internal structure of these being not available. These can be shared with others who can load these NMC files in ArcGIS Explorer at their end. This makes NMC files usable on other user's computers by emailing these to others.
