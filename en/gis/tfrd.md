## What is a TFRD file?

A TFRD file is an imaging data format used by the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency (NGA) to store geospatial data. NGA provides geospatial intelligence that gives advantage in making decisions. TFRD files can store both image and textual data and can be used by GIS applications to render geospatial data.

## TFRD File Format

The internal file format details of TFRD file format are not known. They are, however, saved as compressed files to disc and the compression ratio is greater than the equivalent NITF file format files.
