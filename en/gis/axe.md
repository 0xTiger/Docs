## What is an AXE file?

An AXE file is a GIS file format created with Microsoft AutoRoute routing application. It contains location information for Points of Interest (POI) on the map and other navigation data. These POIs are easy to navigate and could be added to journey as part of the route. AutoRoute was developed to give routes information for navigating roads, motorways through Europe.
