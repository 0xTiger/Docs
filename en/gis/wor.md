## What is a WOR file?

A WOR file is a GIS file used by MapInfo mapping and geographic analysis software. It contains a geographic area that contains a visual map having data about geospatial features such as population and demographic information. You can load a WOR file in MapInfo software to view it and perform different operations on it such as zooming and panning.

## WOR File Format

WOR files comprise of multiple layers that are rendered in a specific order when loaded in MapInfo. Details about WOR file format are not available publicly for developer's reference. WOR files can be converted to QGIS with [QGIS 3.20 Odense](https://www.qgis.org/en/site/forusers/visualchangelog320/index.html#feature-new-embedded-styling-renderer-with-ogr-feature-styles-support).
