## What is an MPS file?

An MPS file is a map file that is used on portable Pocket PC handheld devices. It contains Geographical information about a certain area such as a city or a state. It can be loaded in Pocket PC devices for navigation without the need of fetching LIVE data from any geospatial data server. The MPS file format was developed by Microsoft for Windows based handheld devices and was used in its MapPoint GIS application which has been discontinued long ago now.

## MPS File Format

The internal file structure of MPS file format is not known as it has been discontinued for quite some time now with MapPoint. Some other popular GIS map file formats include [ESRI Shape Files](/gis/shp/), [KML](/gis/kml/), and [KMZ](/gis/kmz/).

## MapPoint Alternative

There are some GIS applications that can be used as alternative to MapPoint.
