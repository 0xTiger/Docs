## What is a QGD file?

The file with extension .QGD file is actually the associated sqlite database of the **QGIS** project that accommodates the auxiliary data for the project. The QGD file will remain empty, if there will be no auxiliary data for the project.

## Details about QGD File Format

In classic mode, the auxiliary database is saved as a file with .qgd extension along the xml file. The **Auxiliary Database** system allows to read and write data in the system as an alternative way. When Creating the QGZ which is a zipped container, the .qgd file includes into the .qgz. 

## What is Auxilary Database?
The Auxiliary Database is actually a standby db system that is created as a response of the duplication of the target database. The auxiliary database is actually a case of a duplicate database would be the database you are duplicating to. E.g. if you setup a standby database using duplicate database, the source database will be the target and the standby database will be known as the auxiliary.
