## What is a GBX file?

The GBX file format is a file format used by the popular racing game series "TrackMania." It is a binary file format that is used to store tracks, cars, and other game-related data. GBX file stores this information along with the roads layout, graphic elements, replays, scenarios, player information in compressed form to reduce disc space. Nadeo game players can host servers in network mode to have multi-player competitions.

One of the key features of the GBX file format is its ability to store a large amount of data in a relatively small file size. This makes it well-suited for use in games, where file sizes can quickly become an issue if not managed properly. The GBX file format is also highly versatile, as it can be used to store a wide variety of game-related data, including 3D models, textures, audio files, and more.

### Drawbacks of GBX File Format

Despite its many advantages, the GBX file format is not without its drawbacks. For one, it is a proprietary format, which means that it can only be used with the TrackMania series of games. This can make it difficult for users to access and use the data stored in GBX files outside of the game. Additionally, the GBX file format is not well-documented, which can make it challenging for developers to work with.
