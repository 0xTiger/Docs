## What is a DEK file?

A file with .dek extension is a deck of cards file used by the online collectible car game, Magic: The Gathering Online (MTGO).  Though in more cases, these deck of cards are playable, in some cases, DEK files list a non-playable collection of cards. These can't be played but act as a subset of a collection. DEK files can be created from [CSV](/spreadsheet/csv/) files by exporting using Delver Lens and can be used in Tabletop Simulator.

## DEK File Format

DEK files are stored as multiline plain text files in [XML](/web/xml/) format that are human-readable. These can be opened with any text editor such as Microsoft Notepad, Notepad++, and Wizards of the Coast Magic: The Gathering Online. DEK files are also used by many Magic players to import/export from many deck-building and websites such as [CardHoarder](https://www.cardhoarder.com/). These websites allow to upload MTGO DEK files as a single or list of files.
