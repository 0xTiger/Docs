## What is a PSS file?

A file with .pss extension is a Sony PlayStation 2 Game Video file and is used to store audio and video data by games for the Playstation 2 console. This video and audio data are actually cutscenes that can be extracted from the PSS files using free utilities. One such utility is the [RipBot](http://forum.doom9.org/showthread.php?t=127611) that has been developed in Delphi to extract the contents from the PSS file. Data from PSS files can be split into its [MPEG2](/video/mpg/) video and [WAV](/audio/wav/) audio components, and converted to different audio and video file formats. PSS files can be opened with applications such as VideoLAN VLC media player, PSS Plex, and PSS Player.

## PSS File Format - More Information

PSS are binary files whose internal file format details are not available publicly. Despite the non-availability of the PSS file structure information, certain utilities are able to split the contents of a PSS file into separate video MPEG2 and audio WAV file formats.
