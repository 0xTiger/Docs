## What is a PXP file?

A PXP file is a game configuration file used by PODBot, a bot plugin for the popular first-person shooter game, Counter-Strike. PODBot allows players to add computer-controlled bots to their Counter-Strike games, providing an additional challenge and allowing them to play even when other players are not available. The PXP file contains the settings and configuration information for the bots, including their skill level, behavior, and other attributes. These files can be customized by players to create their own custom bots, or downloaded from online sources to add pre-made bots to their games.

PODBot is a plugin that lets players include computer-controlled bots in their games of the well-known first-person shooter Counter-Strike. Since its creation in 2002 by Stefan Hendricks, the plugin has been developed and maintained by a developer community. With bots that can move, shoot, and engage with the game environment much like human players, PODBot is made to offer a tough and realistic bot gameplay experience. The plugin has a number of features, including support for several game modes, team cooperation, and customisable bot behaviours and skill levels. “POD” in PODBots stands for "Playing Opposing Defense" Bot. 

Players can use PXP files to customize the bot settings and behaviors, allowing them to create their own custom bots or download pre-made bots from online sources. This makes PODBots a popular choice for players who want to practice their gameplay skills or play the game when other human players are not available.

## How to use PXP with PODBot?

To use a PXP file with PODBot, follow these steps:

1. Locate the PXP file on your computer.
2. Copy the PXP file to the "podbot/pw/" folder in your Counter-Strike installation directory.
3. Launch Counter-Strike and start a new game.
4. Open the console by pressing the "~" key, and type "pb addbot" followed by the name of the PXP file (without the file extension).
5. Press "Enter" to add the bot to your game.

Note that you must have PODBot installed and configured properly in order to use PXP files with Counter-Strike. Also, some PXP files may not be compatible with all versions of PODBot or Counter-Strike, so be sure to check for compatibility before using them.
