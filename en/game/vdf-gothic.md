## What is a VDF file?

A VDF file is a type of file used by the Gothic video game series. It stands for "Video Data File." These files store important information for game, such as virtual worlds, characters, 3D models, textures (images that wrap around 3D objects) and sounds.

For example, in Gothic II, these VDF files are usually kept in "/Gothic II/Data" folder on your computer.

People can technically edit these VDF files using programs like GoMan or a hex-editor (a tool for viewing and editing raw binary data), but it is generally not recommended. If you mess with these files wrong way, you could make them unusable, causing issues with game. So, unless you really know what you're doing, it's best to leave them alone.
