## What is a CON file?

A CON file is a configuration file used by the first-person shooter video game **Battlefield 1942**. It contains configuration information that is loaded and used by the game. There are multiple .con files that define different types of objects such as bot actions, weapons damage, animations, sound in levels, or other characteristics.

## CON File Format

CON files are saved to disc as plain text files that can be opened in any text editor. The settings are saved in text lines that can be edited and saved back for reloading by the game.
