## What is an SIMS3PACK file?

A SIMS3PACK file is a game package created for the open-ended life simulation game, **The Sims 3**. Just in case you haven't played this game, Sims 3 represents participating players in a simulated environment as virtual people called **Sims**. The SIMS3PACK file actually contains information representing parts of the virtual environment such as "Sim" people, clothing, and buildings.

## SIMS3PACK File Format

SIMS3PACK files are saved in binary file format, with no information available about the internal file structure. However, there are third-party Sims 3 package editors available that can be used for generation of SIMS3PACK files. These SIMS3PACK files can be loaded into the game by just double-clicking them provided the game is installed on the system.
