## What is a CT file?

A CT file is a cheat table file created with [Cheat Engine](https://www.cheatengine.org/) software that is used to create modifications to Windows based games for cheating. The Cheat Engine, an open-source cheating engine, examines the executing games and makes a record of its address locations. This information and its overrides are written in the CT file that is then loaded by game players to change game properties such as health score, highest score, and remaining lives.

## Cheat Engine CT File Format

CT files are saved with address locations and other associated information to be hacked inside a game. In most cases, the files are saved as compressed [ZIP](/compression/zip/) archives that can easily be extracted using any standard decompression utility such as WinZIP or 7-Zip.

## How to Use Cheat Tables

 1. Run Cheat Engine
