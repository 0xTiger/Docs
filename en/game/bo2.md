## What is a BO2 file?

A BO2 file is a game file format used by the Minecraft game to store information about custom terrain or objects. BO2 stands for "Binary Objects 2", and it was introduced in the game's 1.5 update as a replacement for the older BO1 format. BO2 files store a  wide variety of information about custom terrain or objects. It includes the shape and appearance of the object, its texture and material properties, and any special behaviour or interactions that it may have.

## BO2 File Format

BO2 files are binary files, which means that they are not human-readable and must be interpreted by the game in order to be understood. This makes them more efficient and compact than text-based formats, but it also means that they cannot be easily edited or viewed without the use of specialized tools. The internal file structure details of BO2 file format are not publicly available for developer's reference.

BO2 files can be used to create everything from simple objects like trees and buildings, to complex structures and landscapes.

## How to Create BO2 file?

BO2 files are created using a tool called MCEdit, which is a popular program used by Minecraft players to create and edit custom terrain and objects. MCEdit allows players to create or import 3D models and then export them as BO2 files, which can be imported into the game and used in a player's world. Another popular tool to create BO2 files is [Terrain Control for Bukkit & Forge](https://dev.bukkit.org/projects/terrain-control).
