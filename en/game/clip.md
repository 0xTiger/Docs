## What is a CLIP file?

A file with .clip extension is a Grand Theft Auto 5 (GTA V) replay file that contains controller input data. Rockstar editor references this data for replaying a sequence from gameplay. It isn't a real video replay but a recording of controller inputs timed to millisecond. This way, the settings of camera angles can be adjusted via the editor. However, the editor can be used to create an actual video in popular video file formats such as [MP4](/video/mp4/). GTA V stores the exported video to C:\Users\YOUR USER NAME\AppData\Local\Rockstar Games\GTA V\videos\rendered.

## CLIP File Format

CLIP files are not real video files. Instead, these contain game data, like position, rotation values for objects, world states and conditions, audio triggers, game camera movements, player actions, stuff like that. These can't be viewed outside of the game.

## How to Record Clips and Access the Rockstar Editor in GTAV?

Once the clip recording is finished, the following steps can be used to record the clips.

 * Pause the game
 * Scroll all the way to the rightmost tab, “Rockstar Editor”
 * Launch the editor from this tab
 * You will be able to select “Clip Management” screen from here and make changes to the clips you’ve recorded in GTA Online or Story Mode.
