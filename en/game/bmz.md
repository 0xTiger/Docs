## What is a BMZ file?

A BMZ file is a Bonus map file used by the 3D puzzle-solving game `Portal` developed by Valve. It contains a bonus map that can be created by third-party community developers as well and imported into the game using inbuilt UI. BMZ comes as [ZIP](/compression/zip/) archive file, having BSP, TGA and [BNS](/game/bns/) files inside it. BMZ files can be opened using Valve Portal and Valve Portal 2.
