Wii U game files are large in size and can also be saved as [WUD](/disc-and-media/wud/) or [WUX](/compression/wux/) files for loading by game emulators. An RPX file contains the entire executable game that comprises of all the game components such as graphics, textures, sequences, and the game ROM.
