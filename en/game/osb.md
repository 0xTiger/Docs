## What is an OSB file?

An OSB file is a storyboard file created by the rhythm game Osu! that lets players tap visual elements on screen with the beats of music. The storyboard inside the OSB file contains a customized animated background that is used throughout behind the game while playing. The background of storyboard is typically a JPG or PNG file that is shown with the OSZ beatmap file during the game.

## OSB File Format

OSB files are stored as plain text files to the disc in beatmap folders. This scheme allows to create different storyboards having different difficulties within a beatmap.
