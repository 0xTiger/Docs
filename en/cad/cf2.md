## What is a CF2 file?

A file with .cf2 extension is a CAD file format that contains 3D package designs or other model data for die cutting. Most of the CAD/CAM machines can process and cut these files. It was created by the National Space Science Data Center (NSSDC) to provide self-describing data storage and manipulation format that matches the structure of scientific data and applications such as statistical and numerical methods, visualization and management. With the passage of time, multiple hardware devices and software applications have been developed that recognize .cf2 files. These applications provide support for CF2 files on Mac OS and Windows Operating Systems.
