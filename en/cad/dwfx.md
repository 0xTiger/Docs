## What is a DWFX file?

DWF and DWFx are secure file formats developed by Autodesk to combine and publish rich 2D- and 3D-design data for sharing with others.

Using DWF and DWFx for Reviewing Design Data
DWF and DWFx are highly compressed file formats and hence more suitable than DWG files for distributing over the Internet for review. You can export a single drawing or publish multiple drawings and sheet sets into a single DWF or DWFx file.

Reviewers don't need to install AutoCAD to review DWF and DWFx files. Instead, they can install the free program, Autodesk Design Review, to view, mark up, print, and track changes. You can read the markups in AutoCAD, change your drawings, change markup status, and republish to DWF or DWFx for further review cycles.

Note: Autodesk Design Review also works with various other file types, including PDF, DXF, and DWG.



A DWFX (Design Web Format XPS) is a a formatted representation of 2D/3D drawing as XPS document. It contains graphics and text as part of design data.
