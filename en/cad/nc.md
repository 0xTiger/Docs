## What is an NC file?

An NC file is a Computer Numerical Control (CNC) file created with [Mastercam CNC software](https://www.mastercam.com/). It comprises of numerical control instructions for directing mechanical movement of a CNC machining tools such as drills, lathes, mills and 3D printers. CNC machines use instructions from the NC files in the form of a sequential program for execution. These instructions from the NC file are meant to guide the machine for production of the component.

## NC File Format

NC files are stored to disc as binary files and their internal file format specifications are not available specifically. Mastercam CNC software lets users create 2D or 3D machine toolpaths. These toolpaths, when saved to disc, generate the .nc file that is finally used by the CNC machine tool to create the desired component.
