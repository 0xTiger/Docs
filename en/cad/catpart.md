## What is a CATPART file?

A CATPART file is the native file format of CATIA V5 software. It stores parts and assemblies created in CATIA V5, a 3D CAD manufacturing application. These files can be opened and edited in CATIA V5 or other CAD applications that support the CATPART file format such as AutoCAD. A CATPART file contains the 3D geometry along with structure data of the models. It is saved to disc in binary file format and has magical number `56 35 5F 43 46 56 32`.
