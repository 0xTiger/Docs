## What is an RML file?

An RML file is an annotation file created and used by Volo View application by Autodesk. It contains annotation information and text marks to be overlaid on the drawing for taking notes. These annotations are displayed in red text over the drawing and that is why the name Redline Markup Language file. Volo View has been discontinued and is no more supported by Autodesk.

## RML File Format


File created by Volo View, a program used for marking up CAD drawings; saved in an XML format and contains annotations and other markups that are displayed in red text when overlaid on a drawing; enables design reviewers to embed notes in CAD drawings.



RML file extension is created by Autodesk, also known as Redline Markup Language File. RML has been classified as CAD Files. This file is saved in an XML format. You can view the XML structure and contents of the file in a text editor<\/a>. You can open RML files in Autodesk AutoCAD program.



## RFT File Format
RFT files are family template files that can either be loaded (along with RFA files) into a project or saved externally while standard Revit family files are saved with .rfa extension. The RFT or family template files store data comprised of 3D images and other graphical elements; used to start a new family from scratch and family files are particularly used to exchange families between projects.
