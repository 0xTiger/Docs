## What is SLDPRT file?

An SLDPRT file is a CAD file generated by SolidWorks software. It is a 3D file format that contains the 3D information of an object or "part". Multiple SLDPRT files having compatible parts can be combined to create a single SLDASM assembly file. SLDPRT files can be opened using [SmartCAM CAD/CAM Software](https://www.solidworks.com/partner-product/smartcam-cadcam-software) by SolidWorks. SolidWorks application converters provide easy to convert tools for conversion of SLDPRT drawing files into neutral data formats such as [TIFF](/image/tiff/), [PDF](/pdf/), OR [PDF/A](/pdf/a/).

## SLDPRT File Format

SLDPRT files are saved as binary files and their exact file format specifications are not available. Some APIs, however, provide the facility to read and convert SLDPRT files to other formats such as [SLDPRT to DXF](https://github.com/GitHubVents/ExportSLDPRTToDXF).
