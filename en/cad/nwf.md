## What is an NWF file?

A file with .nwf extension is an Autodesk's proprietary CAD file format that contains indexes of all model files used by the project. It contains pointers to the elements added to model files for referencing. NWF files also contain information such as viewpoints and redlining. The advantage of using NWF file format is the immediate reflection of changes in the original CAD files [e.g. DWG](/cad/dwg/) due to the associated pointers. The use of an NWF is highly recommended for clash testing. The NWF file saves the original clash results and after modification of the CAD files, the revised CAD files will be opened upon reopening of the NWF file.
