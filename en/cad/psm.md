## What is a PSM file?

A file with .psm extension is a CAD file that is created and opened with Solid Edge CAD modeling software to design 3D parts and assemblies. It contains 3D model of the design for manufacturing parts from the sheet metal. The Solid Edge software suit provides all the necessary options to create a 3D model that can be integrated with other mechanical designs as well. Its 2D Nesting supports both the PSM and PAR file formats in addition to other neutral data formats including DXF and DWG by extracting flat pattern data.

### PSM File Format

PSM is a close file format and its details are not available as of now. These have MIME type application/octet-stream. Metal model files can be imported in Solid Edge and converted to usable parts for making them editable. Synchronous modelling provides higher usability for working with PSM files.
