## What is an ASC file?

ASC files are Autodesk text files that store information about objects in your drawing, including their location, size and color. This makes them a popular choice for exchanging drawings between different [CAD](/cad/) programs. ASC files can be opened with Autodesk's software products. Autodesk provides the option to import ASC files from within the application. ASC files can be opened in any text editor such as Microsoft Notepad, Notepad++, and Apple TextEdit.

## ASC File Format

ASC files are stored to disc in plain ASCII text file format. These are human readable.

### ASC File Example

```
ncols 200
nrows 200
xllcorner 119000.00
yllcorner 158000.00
cellsize 5.00
nodata_value -999999
```
