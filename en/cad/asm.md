## What is an ASM file?

An ASM file is a data file used by [Solid Edge](https://solidedge.siemens.com/en/) 3D CAD modeling, rendering and assembly software. It contains 3D objects that are made up of an assembly of modelled parts. A single ASM file can contain multiple parts to constitute the entire data file. ASM files are totally different than the [assembly language ASM](/programming/asm/) files and has no connection to these. Siemens Solid Edge software is used to open these ASM files.
