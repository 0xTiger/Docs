## What is a PSS file?

A file with .pss extension is used by AutoCAD and contains plot stamp information. It contains Plot stamp information such as date, time, plot scale, paper size, layout name, and plotter specific information. The Plot Stamp command places this stamping information on a specified corner of each drawing and logs it to a file. PSS files can be opened with Autodesk AutoCAD software application.
