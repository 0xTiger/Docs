## What is a REZ file?

The .rez file extension is a plugin file used by Ambrosia Software's Escape Velocity series. These files are used to modify or extend the game by adding new content, such as ships, missions, or graphics. The plugin system is one of the key features that contributed to the series' popularity, as it allowed players to customize their gaming experience and share their creations with others.

## REZ File Format - More Information

Here's a brief overview of how the .rez files work in Escape Velocity:

**Plugin Structure:** The .rez files are essentially containers that hold various resources and scripts for the game. These resources can include graphics, sounds, ship data, mission scripts, and more.

**Customization:** Players and third-party developers can create their own plugins to introduce new elements into the game. This could range from adding new types of ships and weapons to creating entirely new storylines and missions.

**Compatibility:** The plugin system allows multiple plugins to coexist, and players can choose which ones to activate. This means that players can tailor their gaming experience by selecting the plugins that match their preferences.

**Community Contributions:** The Escape Velocity series had a thriving modding community, with many players creating and sharing their own plugins. This contributed significantly to the longevity and replayability of the games.

**Installation:** To use a plugin in Escape Velocity, players typically place the **.rez file** in a designated folder within the game directory. The game's launcher or menu system then allows players to activate or deactivate specific plugins.

## About Ambrosia Escape Velocity

The Escape Velocity series was developed by Ambrosia Software for Macintosh computers. The games are set in a vast, open-ended universe where players can explore, trade, and engage in space battles. The series is notable for its non-linear gameplay, allowing players to choose their own path and allegiances.

The original Escape Velocity game was released in 1996, and it was followed by two sequels: "Escape Velocity Override" (1998) and "Escape Velocity Nova" (2002). These games gained popularity for their immersive gameplay, extensive modding community, and the ability to shape the story based on the player's decisions.

**Note:** Ambrosia Escape Velocity and EV Nova have been discontinued.
