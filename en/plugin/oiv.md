## What is a OIV file?

OIV stands for **OpenIV Package**, and it's a file format specifically designed for easy installation and management of modifications in the Grand Theft Auto V game. It packages a [.XML file](/web/xml/) that has the package description information and scripts along with a .PNG icon for the modifcations. The package is an archive similar to a [.ZIP file](/compression/zip/) format.

## About OpenIV

OpenIV is a popular modding tool used for modifying games that use the RAGE engine, such as Grand Theft Auto IV, Grand Theft Auto V, and Max Payne 3. It allows users to create and install modifications (mods) that can enhance or alter the gameplay experience.

OpenIV provides a user-friendly interface for managing game files, including textures, models, and other assets. It's widely used in the modding community to create custom content, such as new vehicles, characters, and environments. However, it's important to note that while modding can add a lot of creativity and fun to the gaming experience, it may not be officially supported by game developers, and using mods might have implications for the stability or online functionality of the game.
