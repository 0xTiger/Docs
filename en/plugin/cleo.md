A .cleo file is a plugin file used as part of the CLEO library for the GRand Theft Auto games series. It is used for executing modifications which change or expand the gameplay. CLEO file stores a library in the DLL file format, adding useful scripting commands (opcodes) for working with external files to change the game memory. There are different versions of CLEO made for GTA III, GTA Vice City and GTA San Andreas.

CLEO 4 allows to make new opcodes using the source of the CLEO SDK. Three most common examples of such plugin files inlcude:

 * IniFiles.cleo - opcodes for INI files;
 * FileSystemOperations.cleo - opcodes for files and folders.

 Plugins are installed similar to scripts. To install a CLEO plugin, you need to copy the .CLEO file to the CLEO folder.
