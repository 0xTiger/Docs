## What is a DSS file?
The DSS (Digital Speech Standard) is a digital audio file format presented by the **International Voice Association**, a combined venture by Philips, Olympus and Grundig Business Systems. It is a pretty poor and old codec. The DSS file format saves the voice audio data in a compressed format that allows basic recording functionality, such as playing, recording, etc. This format is well suited for dictation because of its ability to record in either overwrite or insert. A file with .dss extension can be written and saved with metadata, such as the audio length, date and time of dictation, and priority. The DSS format is designed typically for speech, similar to [MP3](https://docs.fileformat.com/audio/mp3/) for music. Its quality is kept relatively lower than MP3 to minimize its file size. Since the DSS is highly compressed format, it has a lot of benefits, such as, sending the .dss file anywhere via internet in a quicker way, just because of its greatly reduced size. The smaller size is a useful thing when dealing with huge amounts of files that need to be processed. Although, the DSS file format has a number of benefits, but in term of quality and compatibility with various softwares and devices, many people want to convert their DSS files to MP3. Therefore, a lot of online and downloadable tools are available to **convert DSS to MP3**.
