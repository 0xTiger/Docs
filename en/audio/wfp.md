## What is a WFP file?

A WFP file was a patch file used by the Turtle Beach WaveFront synthesizer cards. It is no more used as Turtle Beach has stopped producing sound cards and synthesizers. The WFP file contains a single program or  patch that can be applied to the synthesizer. WFP files can also be converted to [MP4](/video/mp4/) file format.

## WFP File Format

The internal file format details of WF files are not available. It's been long time since the work on WFP files has been stopped due to no further production of synthesizers by Turtle Beach.
