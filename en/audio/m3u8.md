## What is a M3U8 file?

The M3U8 file format is used by audio and video playback programs to store playlists. The playlist consists of an Internet web path or URL, along with information about each track in the list (playtime duration). M3U8 files use UTF-8 character encoding as compared to [M3U](/audio/m3u/) file types. M3U8 files can be opened using applications like [VideoLAN VLC](https://www.videolan.org/vlc/features.html) media player.

## M3U8 File Format

M3U8 files are stored to disc as text files and are a popular way to store playlists for music playback apps like Spotify, Apple Music and TIDAL. These playlist formatted text documents can also reference online stations that offer streaming content from sites such as YouTube or Twitch TV using URL links in their title tags which is why they're called "m progressives."
