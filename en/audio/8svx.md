## What is an 8SVX file? ##

An 8SVX is the standard file format of audio developed by Electronic Arts. It is considered as a data subtype of the IFF file format. The file is used to store 8-bit audio data within chunks. In separate descriptor chunks metadata is contained about the 8SVX data stream. It is a digital audio file format and is used by Amiga PCs. Computer systems of Amiga are now rarely used so these 8SVX files are usually utilized to preserve and listen to the old music.

## 8SVX File Format ##

8SVX file can store audio recordings in 8-bit quality which is derived from [IFF](/audio/aiff/) specification. These are files that contain audio recordings like other audio-contained files. It also included the container format of IFF. In this format, multiple data formats were embedded in one file and used for further detailing of streams included in it. These can be used alone within the audio-only file containers of IFF files. On the other hand, multiplexing with other subtypes of IFF can result in animated video streams.


## Brief History ##

It was initially released in 1985 by Steve Hayes and Jerry Morrison. Another archived format was developed in 2009. This file format was used on Amiga computer systems for old music. It is also known as the Amiga 8-bit sound file. Audio software made for Amiga PCs supported this file format. It was used by many sound editing programs initially. Most of its data streams are encoded using PCM streams. A modified version of Amiga provided an 8SVX decoder framework. The formats RIFF and WAVE co-developed by Microsoft and IBM are made under the influence of the 8SVX/IFF container format.

## Format Specifications ##

Many programs are associated with these files on Windows and Mac OS. Many programs can be used to tackle these files. It is an encoded audio format for Commodore Amiga. The features like attack, section repeat, and release are supported by these files. These features are used to store samples of musical instruments. The lossy data compression of Fibonacci-delta is available that results in the compression ratio of 50% and decrease the fidelity.
