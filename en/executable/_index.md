Executable files are used to instruct a computer to perform one or multiple tasks or specific operations as the encoded set of instructions; written in those files. The term "Instructions" is usually taken to mean **machine code** instructions for a physical **CPU**. Executable files can be coded by hand in machine language, although it is very convenient to develop software as source code in a high-level language that can be easily understood by humans. Sometime, the source code might be written in assembly language instead, remains closely associated with machine code instructions which are easily human-readable.

Some popular disc file formats are [BAT](/executable/bat/), [CGI](/executable/cgi) and [COM](/executable/com/)
