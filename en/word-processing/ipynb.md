## What is an IPYNB file?

A file with .ipynb extension is a Jupyter Notebook file that contains the entire contents of Notebook created with Jupyter Notebook web application session. [Jupyter Notebook](https://jupyter.org/) is an interactive web application used for creating and sharing computational documents for analysis using Python.

An IPYNB file serves as a complete computational record of a session and includes information such as computational inputs and outputs, mathematical functions, and rich representation of resulting objects such as images and explanatory text.

## IPYNB File Format

IPYNB are saved internally in [JSON](/web/json/) file format which is an open standard file format for sharing data. For this reason, IPYNB files are human-readable and easily understandable. JSON also makes it easy for sharing these files with others.

## How to Convert IPYNB files?

IPYNB files can be exported to several different file formats using the nbconvert command from Jupyter interface. This includes conversion of IPYNB to:

 * PDF
 * HTML
 * reStructuredText
 * LaTex

## How to View IPYNB file?

There are two methods to view or open IPYNB files.

 1. User can upload the .ipynb notebook document to some public URL and open it from Jupyter Notebook Viewer <nbviewer> that renders the notebook as a static web page from URL.
 1. Download the files and open them in their own instance of Jupyter Notebook
