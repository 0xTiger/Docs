## What is a WPD file?

A file with an extension .wpd referred to as a WordPerfect Document Files (WPD). Corel WordPerfect was used to produce this text document. A word processing program is referred to as **WordPerfect**. It is used in a variety of computer systems, including Windows. The WordPerfect is also utilized in business, academic, and home environments for newsletters, resumes, invitations, and letter along with other documents. 

The WPD file contains structured data, and the documents can store various embedded objects such as graphs and graphics developed in other applications. WPD documents also include mail merge elements, which allow information from an external entity, such as a spreadsheet or database, to be inserted into a design. You can double-tap a WPD file and every other document on your PC to open it. If your document associations are accurate, the application designed to open your .wpd document will do so.


## Brief History ##

WordPerfect for Mac was not developed in parallel with editions for other software applications and thus used version numbers that were unrelated to current releases for Os and Windows. Version 2 was a complete revamp that adhered more closely to Apple's user interface principles. 

Version 3 expanded on this, making substantial use of the technology introduced by Apple in Systems 7.0â€“7.5 while staying speedy and capable of working effectively on earlier machines. Version 3.5 was launched in 1996, followed by the upgraded version 3.5e in 1997. It was never updated after that, and the product was finally phased down. Corel has said that it has no intentions to further develop WordPerfect for Mac as of 2004.

## WPD File Format Specifications ##

WPD documents were primarily used to process prepared text. As a result, those files include text chunks. Tags are used to contain formatting information, which WordPerfect recognizes as code. This makes finding formatting issues much easier because the application highlights areas of the text and exposes the inherited formatting. WPD documents, like more popular word processing file types such as [DOC](/word-processing/doc/), can incorporate data from different sources such as files, databases, or designs.
