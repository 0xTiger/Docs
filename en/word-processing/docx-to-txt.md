## What happens when a DOCX is converted to TXT file?

DOCX is a rich media file format that can contain text as well as multimedia information. In addition, it can contain data in tables, images, embedded objects, shapes and many other drawings. In comparison, a .txt file can only contain text data and does not have the capability to contain rich media. Thus, when a DOCX file is converted to TXT, the following happens.

 * All the text formatting is lost
 * Images in the DOCX file are also lost
 * Tables in the DOCX file are also removed and only text is exported to output TXT file
 * Any shapes present in the DOCX file are also removed

In short, any content other than text is removed during conversion from DOCX to TXT.
