## What is a FAQ file?

A FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) file is a text document that contains answers to frequently asked questions asked by users for a particular product, service or inquiry. It is mostly included as a guide or troubleshooting manual with products to facilitate users about the common questions that can arise in their mind about the service. Common information contained in a FAQ file may include queries related to the features of the product, How-to guides, troubleshooting questions, and installation questions. For software products, FAQs have been mostly replaced with the [.chm](/web/chm/) files.

## FAQ File Format - More Information

FAQ files are created and saved as plain text files that are human readable. These can usually be opened in any text editor such as Microsoft Notepad, Microsoft Word, and Apple TextEdit.
