## What is a QPF file?

A file with .qpf extension is a text file created with QuickPad software which is a free application offered by Klumbu, as the evolved version of Notepad for Windows Operating System. QPF files can only be opened and viewed in QuickPad and provide a bare minimum security of sensitive data this way. The text inside the document is not encrypted using any password. Instead, it is encoded by the software to make it somewhat secure.

## QPF File Format

QPF files are text files that are created and saved in human readable form. The only difference is that to read these files, these need to be opened in QuickPad. QuickPad offers features such as Word Wrap, text formatting, auto save, focus mode, and more.
In addition, text can be imported from INI as well as TXT file format.
