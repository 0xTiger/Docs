## What is a CIT file?

A CIT file is a project file generated by the citation-based investigative report writing application In8 Cite. It contains details of the incident in the form of a report and also has a catalog that contains support documentation and evidence cited in the report. Criminal investigators use CIT files for referencing criminal cases during their investigations.

## CIT File Format

CIT files are saved to disc in compressed file format. It uses the standard ZIP compression algorithm to compress files. A CIT file and its supporting documents can be converted and exported to [PDF](/pdf/) file which can shared be with others for review.
