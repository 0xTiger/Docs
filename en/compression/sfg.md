## What is a SFG file?

An SFG file is the file format used by Synfig Studio to save project files. Synfig Studio is a free and open-source 2D animation software that allows users to create high-quality animations using bitmap and vector graphics. SFG file contains all of the information necessary to recreate an animation, including the layers, timing, and keyframes for each layer. It also includes any images or assets used in the project, as well as any audio tracks or other media.
