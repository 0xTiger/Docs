File Compression is the process to reduce the size of one or more files. It shrinks big files into much smaller ones by removing unneeded data.

Moreover, such files make downloading faster easier and allow more data to be stored on removable media. There are various compression formats. Below we are going to discuss the most popular Compression File Formats and the most recommended software that uses it.
