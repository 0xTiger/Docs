## What is an APZ file?

An APZ file is a project file created with AutoPlay Media Studio, a software tool that allows for efficient development of applications. It is exported and saved in a compressed archive format. This format is convenient for several reasons. First, it reduces the size of the project file, making it easier to transfer to other systems or share with others. Second, the compressed file serves as a backup of the project, protecting against data loss or corruption.
