## What is a Linux PUP file?

A Linux PUP file is an installation package used by Puppy Linux operating system. It executes as an installer and starts installing the package files. On Linux, it is often referred to as DotPup file and is similar to the [.exe](/executable/exe/) and [.msi](/executable/msi/) installer files used on Windows OS. The newer versions of Puppy Linux use .pet file format instead of the PUP file format.
