## What is an RTE file?

A file with .rte extension is an encoded file used to exchange copyrighted files. These are data files compressed and encoded to ensure the protection of such files. The compression standard of these RTE encoded files can vary and reduce the file size accordingly. The compression and encoding mechanism ensure the security of the copyright content. The RTE file format is reliably used for exchange of copyrighted content over the internet or through storage media devices like DVDs, CDs, USB flash drives, and external hard disk drives.

## RTE File Format

RTE are compressed files whose file format is not publicly available.
