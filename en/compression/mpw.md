## What is an MBW file? ##

A file with .mbw extension is primarily associated with MBRWizard by Firesage Solutions. The Master Boot Record Wizard (MBRWizard) backs up your computer's MBR and saves it to an MBW file that can be restored if needed. In addition to MBR and VBR (Volume Boot Record) copies, these files can contain GPT, user-defined sectors, or whole disk images. The MBR is a vital, 512-byte long record on your hard drive that allows your Operating System to boot. It can also hold the partition table and a 32-bit signature identifying the disk media. 

## Supported Operating Systems ##

The MPW file format is only supported by the Windows operating system.

## Possible problems while opening the file ##

If you are not being able to open and run the MBW file, there might be one of the following possible problems:

 *  Corrupt MBW file
 *  Wrong links to the MBW file in registry entries
 *  Deleted description of the MBW from the Windows registry
 *  An infected file with an undesirable malware
 *  The computer does not have sufficient hardware resources to operate the MBW file
 *  Drivers used by the computer to open an MBW file are outdated
