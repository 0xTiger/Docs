## What is an APK file?

A file with .apk extension is a Google Android app file that is used to install apps (applications) on the Android devices. It is created as an executable file using the official IDE Google Android Studio, and is uploaded to Google Play store to be downloaded and installed by end users. APK files can be generated and made available for manual installation as well prior to publishing to Google Play store. This helps in testing the functionality and behaviour of the generated APK package file. Therefore, one needs to be sure that the APK file is from a trusted source and does not contain any malware.

## APK File Format

APK files are packaged as compressed in [ZIP](/compression/zip/) file format that can be opened with any ZIP file opening software. The .apk extension of such a file can be renamed to .zip and open the file in any ZIP application or extract its contents.

 * `META-INF/`: Directory that contains the manifest file, signature, and a list of resources in the archive
 * `lib/`: Directory containing compiled code related to specific platforms such as armeabi-v7a, x86, arm64-v8a, etc.
