## What is a 7Z file?

**7z** is an archiving format for compressing files and folders with a high compression ratio. It is based on Open Source architecture which makes it possible to use any compression and encryption algorithms. The format is now supported by a number of software applications such as [7-ZIP](https://www.7-zip.org/) which is publicly available for download and usage to manipulate .7z files. Files with .7z extension have mime-type application/x-7z-compressed.

## Supported Compression Methods in 7z ##

7z can support any compression methods due to its open architecture. Below is a list of compression methods currently available and supported by 7z.

* LZMA - Improved and optimized version of the LZ77 algorithm
* LZMA2 - Improved version of LZMA
* PPMD - Dmitry Shkarin's PPMdH with small changes
* BCJ - Converter for 32-bit x86 executables
* BCJ2 - Converter for 32-bit x86 executables
* BZIP2 - Standard BWT algorithm
* Deflate - Standard LZ77-based algorithm

## 7z File Format Specifications

7z uses binary file format to store the compressed archives. The development and implementation of 7-ZIP archiver published the first appearance of the 7z file format. Its format specifications are accessible as plain text format under the "Docs" sub-directory in code repository of 7-ZIP which is publicly available under the [GNU Lesser General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html). LZMA is the default compression method used by 7z files.

### File Signature

7z files begin with signature bytes '7' 'z' BC AF 27 1C.

### AES Encryption

The 7z file format supports 256-bit AES encryption with the ability to encrypt the filenames of a the archive. The key for encryption is user-defined, based on the SH-256 hash function.

## Salient Features of 7z

**7z** is the new archive format, providing high compression ratio. The main features of **7z** format include:

* Open file format under [GNU Lesser General Public License](https://www.gnu.org/copyleft/lesser.html) that lets you use any compression and encryption method
* High compression ratio
* Strong AES-256 encryption
* Support for large files with size up to 16,000, 000, 000 GB (16 exbibytes)
* Unicode file names
* Solid compressing
* Archive headers compressing
