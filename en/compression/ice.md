## What is an ICE file?

A file with .ice extension is a compressed archive created with [ICEOWS](http://www.iceows.com/index.html) (Interface de Compression Ergonomique pour windOWS) software utility that was formerly known as ArjFolder. It provides excellent compression for reducing the size of text files.

It also lets you extract contents of archive files and supports ICE, ARJ, [ZIP](/compression/zip/), [GunZip](/compression/gz/), [TAR](/compression/tar/), Microsoft CAB, [RAR](/compression/rar/), ACE, MIME, Mac HQX, UUEncode, XXEncode, Base64, [JAR](/programming/jar/), EAR, WAR, LHA, IMP, [BZ2](/compression/bz2/) file formats.
