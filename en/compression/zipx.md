## What is a ZIPX file?

A ZIPX file is an extended version of the standard ZIP file that has been compressed using an advanced version of compression. This advanced compression method is developed by CorelWinZip that compresses all the files using the extended ZIPX format. ZIPX files are smaller in size than [ZIP file format](/compression/zip/) and makes data transfer over the internet more efficient. ZIPX files require WinZip to be installed on the system in order to open them.

## ZIPX File Format

ZIPX files are saved to disc as binary files and the internal file format details are not available publicly. If your system doesn't have WinZip installed, you will not be able to open these files. ZIPX files are identified from metadata present in the file structure that lets the reading applications open them correctly. WinZip supports several different types of compression algorithms as follow.

 * BZip
 * LZMA
 * PPMd
 * XZ*
 * MP3^**
 * Jpeg**
 * Wavpack**
