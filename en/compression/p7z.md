## What is a P7Z file?

A P7Z file is a compressed file that contains an email message in the S/MIME encryption standard. It was introduced by Microsoft Corporation and is categorized as Email related data file. P7Z files have application/pkcs7-mime media type. It contains one or more parts of a message that is compressed with zlib compression algorithm.
