## What is an XPD file?

An XPD file is a webpage file created from an XML document. More often, this is generated through an XSLT transformation. The [XPD file format specifications](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml-pipeline/) are available on W3 that define a way to increase interoperability of multi-process [XML](/web/xml/) applications. The XML Pipeline Language defines the processing relationships between XML resources.
