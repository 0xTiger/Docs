## What is a CSP file?

A CSP file is a dynamic web page file that contains content written to be executed on RadGs Concept Application Server. It is compiled and executed on server side, after which it is served to requesting user's browser via HTTP protocol. Unlike CON file format, CSP files do not require the Concept client to be installed at user for viewing these files. You can view CSP files similar to any other server side pages such as [PHP](/programming/php/) and [ASP](/web/asp/).
