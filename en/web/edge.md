## What is an EDGE file?

A file with .edge extension is Adobe Edge Project file that is created when a project is created and saved with Adobe Edge. Adobe Edge lets web designers to create interactive [HTML](/web/html/) animators for web, digital publishing, and rich media advertising for both desktop and mobile browsers. This is achieved using HTML/HTML5, [JavaScript](/web/js/), and [CSS3](/web/css/). Edge files are generated as plain text files and can be opened with several different applications such as Microsoft Notepad, Apple TextEdit, and Notepad++.

## EDGE File Format

EDGE files are saved in a plain text format and uses jQuery for enabling the animation. An alternative of EDGE animation was Flash files that are no more supported. EDGE file is saved alongside the HTML, JavaScript, and CSS files. Upon opening the EDGE file, the web page i.e. the HTML file is opened.
