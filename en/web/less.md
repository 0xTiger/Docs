## What is a LESS file?

A LESS file is a style sheet used for webpages and created with the Leaner Style Sheets (LESS). It implements additions to the standard CSS language, that makes it easy to learn and implement. A LESS file extends the CSS by adding features such as Variables, Mixins, Nesting, Operations, Functions, Namespaces and Accessors.
