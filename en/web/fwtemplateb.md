## What is a FWTEMPLATEB file?

An FWTEMPLATEB file is a website template document bundle used by the Freeway Pro, a software app for creating websites without writing any code. It contains multiple website templates that can be shared with other Freeway Pro users as well. Each template website in the bundle contains information about the layout and appearance of the site.

## FWTEMPLATEB File Format

FWTEMPLATEB files are saved as a collection of website templates and contain information related to the site appearance. These provide easiest way for creating a website as all the layout and appearance settings are already done in the template file. Another advantage of FWTEMPLATEB files is that you get a bundle of templates for creating websites easily.
