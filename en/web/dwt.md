## What is a DWT file?

A file with a .dwt extension is a webpage template file created with Dreamweaver software. It is used as a starting point to develop multiple pages that have the basic settings defined already in the template. New [HTML](/web/html/) pages can be built using copies of these templates and changing the content where necessary, while keeping the common sections unchanged. The non-editable regions of these templates such as header, footer, and menu remain the same across all the webpages.

## DWT File Format - More Information

DWT files are developed and saved as plain text files. These can be opened in Dreamweaver or any text editor, and can be edited for changes required. Dreamweaver software updates the UI as changes are applied and user can observe the effect of changes visually in application's user interface.

Whenever you save the [HTML] page (/ web / html /) as a template file, Dreamweaver creates a template folder at the root level of the local root folder. The link is broken if the .dwt file is moved from the Templates folder or it is renamed. Thus, it is important to keep the .dwt files in the Templates folder where Dreamweaver creates it. It is better to keep other elements of your site, such as image source files or HTML documents, at a location other than the Templates folder.

## About Dreamweaver
