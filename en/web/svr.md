## What is an SVR file?

An SVR file is a 3D file format used by SuperScape to create 3D interactive worlds. These three-dimensional interactive worlds can be viewed through web browsers with the SVR plugin. SVR files are similar to [VRT file](/web/vrt/) format but are compressed that results in smaller file size. Thus, SVR files are loaded faster and can also be shared over internet.

## SVR File Format - More Information

SVR files are saved to disc in binary file formats. It is a proprietary file format and its internal file structure details are not available publicly for developer's reference.
