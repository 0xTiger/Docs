## What is a MHT file?

A file with .mht extension is a MIME enabled archiving file format that contains different types of data into a single file. It can store data such as text, images, page styling in the form of [CSS](/web/css/) files, JavaScript, and other resources as embedded resources in it. MHT files, having MIME type message/rfc822, encapsulate all the contents of an HTML file as a single archive file for storing on archiving on storage devices. Software applications such as Microsoft Word lets you convert your WORD documents to MHT by exporting as MHT file. MHT files can be opened using popular browsers such as Microsoft Internet Explore and Google Chrome.

## MHT File Format

Like [MHTML](/web/mhtml/), MHT is also a MIME encapsulation of aggregate HTML documents. Document contents inside an MHT document such as inline pictures, style sheets, applets, etc. are MIME-ecncoded where these are linked to a root resource via URIs. Email clients such as Microsoft Outlook stores emails (usually [EML](/email/eml/)) in MHT file format. Complete specifications of MHT file format are available in the [RFC 822](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc822) and can be referred to for software application development that can process MHT files.

## Difference between MHT and MHTML

While saving an online page, the user is asked to settle on the kind of file format within which the online page must be saved on the native system. Most typically, the user gets confused between markup language and MHTML file formats. They notice it troublesome to see that file format is healthier between these.

When a user decides to avoid wasting online page as markup language, then a folder is formed, that contains multiple files for various contents of the page i.e. totally different files area unit created for text, graphics, applets etc. On the opposite hand, saving the online page as MHTML creates one file for the complete online page. All the elements of page together with graphics, links and alternative files area unit embedded inside one file.

Naturally, it's straightforward to handle MHT or MHTML files because the file, that may be protected and shared simply through the e-mail. However, the markup language files area unit beneath the chance of information loss as loss or deletion of even one file could produce the complete markup language folder useless for the user.
