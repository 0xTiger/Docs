## What is a CCBJS file?

A CCBJS file is a Javascript file created by the 3D app, game, and website editor, **CopperCube**. It contains the JavaScript code that is generated as part of the [.html file](/web/html/) created from the .ccb file. CopperCube provides a user-friendly scripting interface to develop gameplay logic and interactions without writing any code. Other file formats supported by CopperCube include .ccscene, .ccmodel, .ccmaterial, .cctex, .ccjs, .ccp, and .ccpak.

## CCBJS File Format

The internal file format details of CCBJS file format are not known as such. Javascript files, however, are saved as plain text files to disc and can be opened with any text editor such as Microsoft Notepad, Notepad++, and Apple TextEdit.
