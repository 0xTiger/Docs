## What is a STC file?

A file with .stc extension is a connection file used by Adobe Contribute software to store the connection information. It contains connection information such as username, host url, protocols such as FTP, SFTP, etc. for reuse from within the existing website. For those who don't know, Adobe Contribute used to be a specialized [HTML](/web/html/) editor that was used to push updates to existing websites including content based articles known as blogs. It included plugins for popular web browsers such as Internet Explorer and Firefox that seamlessly contributed content to websites from within the pages. It has been discontinued since January 2017  and Adobe Dreamweaver is used now for creating websites from scratch.

## STC File Format

The internal data format of STC files is unknown. However, the connection key is encrypted with a password and any network or FTP login connection information sent in the file remains secure and can only be accessed through Contribute. The Key connection file can be emailed to users or saved to computer. When it is clicked, it automatically opens Contribute which imports the connection.
