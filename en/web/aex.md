## What is an AEX file?

An AEX file (with .aex extension) is a compiled [Xbasic](https://documentation.alphasoftware.com/documentation/pages/Ref/Xbasic/index.xml) file that contains compiled program code for global functions. It can be used in web applications by calling them from server side [.a5w](/web/a5w/) pages. AEX files were loaded and unloaded by calling a5w_load_aex and a5w_unload_aex functions respectively from A5W files. However, in new implementation, these files are loaded into memory by including in the a5_application.5i file. Xbasic programming language is used by Alpha Anywhere software for development of Mobile and Web applications.

## AEX File Format - More Information

AEX files are saved to disc in binary file format and contains compiled code of functions written in Xbasic. Xbasic script command statements determine the structure and flow of execution including performing or stopping a repeated action, or making a choice between two or more steps based on conditions. [Xbasic Language Reference](https://documentation.alphasoftware.com/documentation/pages/Ref/Xbasic/index.xml) can be consulted for detailed information about it.
