## What is a WEBBOOKMARK file?

A WEBBOOKMARK file is a bookmarks file saved with Apple's Safari web browser on macOS. It contains informaiton about the webpage that user has saved from the browser. Information stored in a WEBBOOKMARK file includes the page title, URL, and the bookmark group to which this page is stored. When a webpage is bookmarked, Safari browser asks the group for storing the bookmarked page. Most users save the bookmarks in Bookmarks folder which is the default location offered by common browsers.

## WEBBOOKMARK File Format

WEBBOOKMARK files are saved to disc in binary file format that are not human-readable. Users can mark a webpage bookmarked if it is intented to be visited later on or relates to user's interests. When required, user can navigate to the bookmarks section in Safari browser and visit the page again.
