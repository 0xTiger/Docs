## What is a CRDOWNLOAD file?

A CRDOWNLOAD file is a partially downloaded file that is created when you download a file from internet using Microsoft Edge, Google Chrome, or Chromium browsers. The contents of file being downloaded are stored in this file until the download completes. Once the download completes, the .crdownload extension is removed and is replaced with the original file extension of the file being downloaded.

## CRDOWNLOAD File Format

A CRDOWNLOAD file can be in text as well as binary format. Browsers create .crdownload file by default once the download starts. If the download is interrupted in between, the CRDOWNLOAD file remains saved to disc. This sometimes allows to resume download from where it was interrupted.

### CRDOWNLOAD Example

Support you are downlaoding a file fileformatslist.doc from internet. When the download starts, your browser saves the file to Downloads folder as fileformatslist.crdownload file. Its file size increases as the file gets downloaded. Once the download completes, the file will be renamed to fileformatslist.doc.
