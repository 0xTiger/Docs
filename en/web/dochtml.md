## What is a DOCHTML file?

A DOCHTML file is the HTML format of a document generated with Microsoft Word. It is the [HTML](/web/html/) version of the document created that can be used for publishing to web server. DOCHTML files can be opened in web browser for viewing the contents of the converted word document. The outlook and appearence of the DOCHTML file is same as that of the original Word document.

## DOCHTML File Format

DOCHTML files are saved to disc in HTML format that is ready to be published on web servers. Microsoft Word stopped support for saving documents as DOCHTML files. This was replaced with [.mht](/web/mht/) and [.mhtml](/web/mhtml/) file formats that are commonly used now.
