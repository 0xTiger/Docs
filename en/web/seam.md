## What is an SEAM file?

A SEAM file is a configuration file used by the JBOS Seam framework. It contains metadata/reference to a server-side servlet that processes requests to the web application. It also contains metadata about Seam components such as the names of classes and methods that implement the components. You can use SEAM files in conjunction with JavaServer Faces (JSF) framework for building dynamic and interactive web applications. SEAM files are usually stored in the WEB-INF directory of a Seam application.

## SEAM File Format

A SEAM file is stored as text file, typically in [XML](/web/xml/) format, and contains configuration information for a Seam application. It is a key part of the configuration of a Seam application. You can open a SEAM file with any text or XML editor.
