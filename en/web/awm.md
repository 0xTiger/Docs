## What is an AWM file?

An AWM file is a project file created by the Web menu builder program, **AllWebMenus**. It contains project related data for creating [HTML](/web/html/) based drop-down menus. An AWM file is compiled into a finalized web package that integrates into the websites to display the menus. It contains all the project related data such as appearance settings, menu entries, style (vertical or horizontal), colors, and other related information.

AWM files can be opened with **Likno AllWebMenus**.

## AWM File Format - More Information

AWM files are saved as compiled binary files and can only be opened with Likno AllWebMenus software. The internal file format details of AWM files are not available publicly.

AllWebMenus lets you design [CSS](/web/css/) menus or [JavaScript](/web/js/) based menus visually without using any programming language. The menus can be fully customized as well as designed using predefined appearance templates available with the software.
