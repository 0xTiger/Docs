## What is a WBS file?

A WBS file is a project file created by WebBlender that is a presentation and web site creation program for kids. The WBS file is created when a new project is initiated in WebBlender. All the site features added to the project such as pages, images, text, animations and so on, are referenced in the WBS project file. Once the project is ready, it publishes the site contents as [HTML](/web/html/) file. WebBlender is created and maintained by [Tech4Learning](https://www.tech4learning.com/).
