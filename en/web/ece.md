## What is an ECE file?

An ECE file is a dynamically generated web page by the content management platform, **Escenic Content Engine (ECE)**. It contains server-side code that is processed by the web server and served back to the user browser as [HTML](/web/html/) page.  ECE file format is not very commonly popular as compared to other server side file formats such as ASP and PHP. These files are rendered internally and served to end users for display purpose.

## ECE File Format

ECE files are not saved to disc but are served directly to user upon request. These are converted to HTML and send back to user's browser for display. Escenic Content Engine is actively used for publishing news article pages. Based on JEE and SQL technology, the ECE server provides reliable and scalable repository for all online content.

Client browsers can access the content on ECE servers through HTTP/REST API. In addition to serving [HTML](/web/html/) pages, ECE provides highly efficient workflow for managing and publishing video/audio content.
