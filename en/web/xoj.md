## What is an XOJ file?

An XOJ file is a notebook file that contains notes taken using the hand note-taking software Xournal. Xournal is a free, multi-platform application that lets you create notes with different content types such as text, images, and hand-written doodles. XOJ files are created when a new notebook file is created with Xournal. These XOJ files can be shared with other users as well for data sharing. A more recent version of Xournal is [Xournal++](https://github.com/xournalpp/xournalpp) that is cross-platform variant of Xournal.

## XOJ File Format

XOJ files are in XML file format and save to disc in compressed form using the [.gz](/compression/gz/) compression. Due to the use of universal XML format, XOJ files can also be opened and edited with the Xournal++ cross-platform variant.

Each XOJ file may contain one more pages of a Xournal notebook.

## XOJ - Supported Platforms

Xournal is multi-platform and its notebooks can be saved as XOJ file on the following operating systems.

 * Linux
