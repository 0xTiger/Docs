## What is WEBLOC?

A WEBLOC file is a shortcut file on macOS that points to a web URL on internet. It is generated by dragging the web URL from browser's address bar to desktop or any other folder where it is meant to be saved. The URL to destination site is stored inside this shortcut file and can be viewed by opening the file in a text editor such as Microsoft Notepad, Notepad++, or Apple TextEdit. WEBLOC files are similar to the [URL](/web/url/) files.

## WEBLOC File Format - More Information

WEBLOC files are stored in plain text file format. These can be generated on macOS by dragging URLs from web browsers such as Safari, Google Chrome, or Firefox. If multiple WEBLOC files are to be opened simultaneously, a more fast and easiest solution of opening these via external applications or APIs would be required. These APIs can read and convert WEBLOC to PDF and JPEG.
