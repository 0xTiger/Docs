## What is an SITE file?

A SITE file is a project file used by website design software `Adobe GoLive`. It stores website project information such as files, folders, images, custom style sheets, and scripts. It also contains the website structure and links used in the site web pages. As it is a project file, it contains references to project files but do not contain the actual files itself.

Adobe GoLive has been discontinued and is no longer supported.

## SITE File Format

SITE files are stored to disc in Adobe proprietary file format and the internal details of its file format are not available publicly for developer's reference.
