## What is a CHA file?

A CHA file is a user settings file created by the IRC clients such as mIRC. It contains parameters such as the server, port, channel name and, optionally, a password for opening an IRC channel. IRC clients are used to communicate with others on the IRC networks around the world. These are used for one-to-one private discussions or in multi-group conferences. When a CHA file is clicked, the IRC client automatically opens with the details mentioned in the file.

Applications that can open CHA files include mIRC and Visual IRC.

## CHA File Format

CHA files are stored alongside other installation files of the IRC client. When a user wants to connect to a server and join a channel, he enters the information in the client. This information is stored in the CHA file that can be retrieved at any time.
