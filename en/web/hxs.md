## What is an HXS file?

An HXS file is a help file compiled and used for Microsoft Help 2.x file. It is compiled and generated from a set of topic pages and written in a subset of [HTML](/web/html/) that is similar to the earlier [CHM](/web/chm/) Help File Format. HXS files are stored in compressed format and is created from a .HxC main project file, a .HxF include file, a .HxT table of contents, a .HxA attribute definition file, and several .HxK indexes. The metadata of an HXS file is created from [XML](/web/xml/).

HXS files can be opened with a web browser.

## HXS File Format

HXS files are created and saved as compressed files from HTML content and XML metadata.
