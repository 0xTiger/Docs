## What is an ALX file?

An ALX file is an ActiveX file that is embedded in Web pages in the form of [HTML](/web/html/) components. ActiveX controls were formally known as OLE controls or OCXs. ALX files can be used to insert a variety of functionalities in a web page  such adding a timer control for updating the page's content periodically, or add a Popup window control for displaying tooltip-style help based on user action. ALX files care linked using <Param> tag within HTML code of a web page. You can open ALX files in Microsoft Internet Explore, Microsoft ActiveX Control Pad, and text editors such as Notepad and Notepad++.

## ALX File Format - More Informaiton

ALX files are in plain text file format and can be edited by opening these in a text editor. ActiveX controls can be included in a web page by dropping onto web page. However, in order to build dynamic web pages, the controls are integrated together with the help of [JScript](/web/js/). Controls on a web page are associated with the events and values of the controls, thus giving complete control for user interactions.
