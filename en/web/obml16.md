## What is an OBML16 file?

An OBML16 file is a webpage saved using the Opera Mini mobile web browser. It is based on the Opera Binary Markup Language ([OBML](/web/obml/)) and is a compact format for giving fast access to saved webpages. It replaced the [OBML15](/web/obml15/) file format when Opera Mini version 7 was launched. All these variants of Opera Mini webpages were upgraded from the base OBML file format and each upgrade of Opera Mini is compatible with one OBML format only. OBML16 files can be converted to [PDF](/pdf/) and [HTML](/web/html/) online.

Once downloaded, Opera Mini users can view these pages without the need of having access to an Internet connection.
