## What is a CRL file?

A CRL (Certificate Revocation List) file is a blacklist of X.509 digital certificates that a certificate authority (CA) revokes prior to their assigned revocation date. It contains information about the issue and the revocation date that lets the security administrators to block affected digital certificates. CRL doesn't include expired certificates as its main purpose is to notify about the untrusted and invalid certificates.

Applications that can **open CRL files** include OpenSSL, Microsoft IIS Server, and Citrix NetScaler.

CRL files contain information in the X.509 standard which also defines its semantics for sharing public key information. Other information contained inside a CRL file may include the time limit for which the certificates have been revoked, reason for the revocation, serial number of revoked certificate and timestamp.
