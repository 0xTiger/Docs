## What is an FREEWAY file?

A FREEWAY file is a settings information file created and used by the Freeway Pro software, a WYSIWYG app on MacOS for creating websites. It contains information about a website such as site's appearance and layout including font, background appearance, margins, and links to resources that are loaded at runtime. This information is used for creating website that has the layout and arrangement of UI elements as per the information in the file.

## FREEWAY File Format

FREEWAY files are saved in proprietary file format and their internal file format details are not available publicly. It doesn't have any actual resources used by a site, but instead the site layout and links to different properties. The actual website resources and pages are saved to the "Media" and "Site Folder" folders that are located in the same folder as the FREEWAY file. The FREEWAY document can be exported to a variety of formats including [HTML](/web/html/), [JPEG](/image/jpeg/), [PNG](/image/png/), [BMP](/image/bmp/), and [GIF](/image/gif/).
