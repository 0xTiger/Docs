## What is an EPIBRW file?

An EPIBRW file is a generic file hosted on Microsoft IIS-based web server. The purpose of this file is not specific to any specific operations or any kind of data storage, but is general. It is most often used by [.pdf](/pdf/) files but can be utilized by several other file types as well.

When an EPIBRW file is double clicked, it may open in browser displaying the contents. However, if the file is linked for download, the file download process will initiate as result of this event.
