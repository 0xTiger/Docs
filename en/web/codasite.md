## What is a CODASITE file?

A CODASITE file is a website project file created with [Coda](https://coda.io/) webpages creation and publishing software. It contains a list of all the files that are part of the project. This includes webpages as [HTML](/web/html/) files, cascading stylesheet [CSS](/web/css/) files, Javascript [JS](/web/js/) files, and any other related supporting files. CODASITE project files also contain information for website publishing to the web server.

## CODASITE File Format

CODASITE project file is saved to disc as binary files inside the ~/​Library/​Application Support/​Coda 2/​Sites/​ directory. Coda user interface provides the interface for managing Coda sites as manually opening these can lead to improper project settings and create issues.
