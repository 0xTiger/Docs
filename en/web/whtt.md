## What is a WHTT file?

A WHTT file is an offline version of a website which is downloaded using the [HTTrack Website Copier](https://www.httrack.com/) software. It contains all the contents of a website including [HTML](/web/html/) webpages, images, stylesheets, links and directories. All the pages of a website are downloaded recursively and saved to disc as offline mirror. When a website is downloaded by the HTTrack software, it can be viewed offline without the need of being connected to the internet. In order to view the downloaded website, simply open page of the mirrored website in the browser and each image/link will be loaded properly.

## WHTT File Format

WHTT files are saved as a combination of THML webpages, images, stylesheets, and reference links.
