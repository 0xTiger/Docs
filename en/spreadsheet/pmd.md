## What is a PMD file?

A PMD file is a spreadsheet file created with [PlanMaker](https://www.softmaker.de/softmaker-office-planmaker) software that comes with SoftMaker Office. It stores spreadsheet data in rows and columns similar to Excel files. [XLSX](/spreadsheet/xlsx/) is the standard file format of PlanMaker that makes it easy to use the software instead of Microsoft Excel. A PMD file can contain formulas and charts in addition to data stored in cells. Files created with PlanMaker can be opened with Microsoft Excel without any additional conversion. It can also edit [XLS](/spreadsheet/xls/) files and supports additional file formats such as [PDF](/pdf/).

## PMD File Format

PMD files are stored to disc as binary files in proprietary file format and its specifications are not available publicly.
