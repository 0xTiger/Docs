## What is an AST file?

An AST file is a spreadsheet template file created with the Ability Spreadsheet software, a spreadsheet component of the Ability Office suite. These template files are used to create an initial set of spreadsheet templates that can be used to create [AWS](/spreadsheet/aws/) files. AST files can be opened with Ability spreadsheet software.

## AST File Format - More Information

AST files are saved to disc as binary files and can be opened in Ability Spreadsheet software. Though fully compatible with Microsoft XLS and XLSX file formats, AST file format specifications are not available publicly for developer's reference. AST files can be saved to disc in [PDF](/pdf/) as well as [XPS](/page-description-language/xps/) file formats.
