## What is a CTS file?

A CTS file is a spreadsheet file created with the open-source multiplatform data entry and organization program, **TreeSheets**. It contains hierarchical data entered different formats inside the spreadsheet such as notes, lists, calendars, to-do lists, notes, mind maps and a number of other formats. CTS files can only be opened with TreeSheets which is lightweight, fast, and works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## CTS File Format - More Information

TreeSheets saves CTS files in its own proprietary file format. The file format specifications of CTS file format are not available publicly and that is why CTS files can only be opened in TreeSheets software.

### Export TreeSheets CTS Files to Other Formats

TreeSheets users can export the CTS spreadsheets to several different file formats. CTS files can be exported to [HTML](/web/html/), [JSON](/web/json/), [CSV](/spreadsheet/csv/), and [Image](/image/) file formats.
