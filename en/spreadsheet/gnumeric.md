## What is a GNUMERIC file?

A file with GNUMERIC file extension is a spreadsheet file created with the Gnumeric software that is part of [GNOME](https://www.gnome.org/) desktop application suite. It can store worksheet data along with support for charts, formatting options, and other data. Data in a GNUMERIC file is stored in [XML](/web/xml/) file format and compressed using the [GZIP](/compression/gz/) compression scheme. GNUMERIC files are also saved in the [GNM](/spreadsheet/gnm/) file format.

## GNUMERIC File Format

GNUMERIC files are saved in XML file format, compressed suing GZIP compression. These don't support Macros and Pivot Tables, but are rich with other features such as conversion to [CSV](/spreadsheet/csv/), [XLSX](/spreadsheet/xlsx/), Microsoft Works (.wks), [HTML](/web/html/), [LaTex](/word-processing/latex/), and [Lotus 1-2-3](/spreadsheet/123/).
