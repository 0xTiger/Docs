## What is an IMP file? ##

An IMP file is a spreadsheet file created with [Lotus Improv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lotus_Improv) software to store data in rows and columns. Contents in an IMP file is separated in three different segments; namely data, view of the data, and formulas. Though the purpose of this approach was to make it easy to make editing simple, this made it difficult to transfer data from an IMP file to other common application file types such as Excel. IMP files have been marked as obsolete and is no longer a supported file format. Lotus Improv was later acquired by IBM in 1996.

## IMP File Format

IMP files are stored on disc as binary files and their internal file format is not available publicly. Lotus Improv was replaced by IBM Lotus 1-2-3 later on.
