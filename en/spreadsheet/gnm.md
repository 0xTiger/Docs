## What is an GNM file?

GNM file is a spreadsheet file created with [Gnumeric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gnumeric) that is a spreadsheet program and comes as part of [GNOME](https://gnome.org/) Desktop Software. It stores spreadsheet data in rows and columns, and provides support for charts and other spreadsheet functionality. GNM files are saved to disc in [XML](/web/xml/) file format (similar to XLSX) and are compressed using the [GZIP](/compression/gz/). Gnumeric aim was to provide open source spreadsheet application that will eventually provide alternative to Microsoft Excel.

## GNM File Format

GNM files are compressed XML files that can be extracted with standard decompression utilities such as WinZIP. Though it is rich with features, Gnumeric doesn't support Macros and Pivot Tables.

## Features Supported in GNM Files

Since Gnumeric supports several different file formats, it can convert the native GNM files to [CSV](/spreadsheet/csv/), [XLSX](/spreadsheet/xlsx/), Microsoft Works (.wks), [HTML](/web/html/), [LaTex](/word-processing/latex/), and [Lotus 1-2-3](/spreadsheet/123/).

## Gnumeric on Github

Gnumeric's open-source development is hosted and maintained on [Gnumeric official Github](https://github.com/GNOME/gnumeric) repository.
