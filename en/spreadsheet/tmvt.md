## What is a TMVT file?

A TMVT file is a TimeMap timeline spreadsheet template file that contains predefined settings for creating [TMV files](/spreadsheet/tmv/). In contrast to TMV files, TMVT contains settings such as fact flag styles, backgrounds, title styles and scale styles. TMVT files can be shared with users and reused by them to retain the same settings and create their own timeline files for uniformity. These can be opened with TimeMap software by [LexisNexis](https://www.lexisnexis.com/en-us/products/casemap.page).

## TMVT File Format

TMVT files are created and saved to disc in binary file format.
