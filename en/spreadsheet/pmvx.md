## What is a PMVX file?

A file with .pmvx extension is a spreadsheet template file created with [PlanMaker](https://www.softmaker.de/softmaker-office-planmaker) spreadsheet program, that comes as part of Softmaker Office. Data is stored in rows and columns in PMVX files in the same way as is done in Microsoft Excel. PMVX files store predefined settings as a template that can be used to generate PMD and PMDX files after populating data in it. [XLSX](/spreadsheet/xlsx/) is the default file format for PlanMaker and these can be opened directly with Microsoft Excel. You can also edit [XLS](/spreadsheet/xls/) files and create [PDF](/pdf/) files using PlanMaker.

## PMVX File Format

PMVX files are stored to disc in PlanMaker's proprietary file format and their internal file structures are unknown. As far as saving PMVX files is concerned, it saves the data to the Open XML format as XLSX files.
