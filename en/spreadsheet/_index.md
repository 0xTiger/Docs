A **spreadsheet** file contains data in the form of rows and columns. A spreadsheet file can be saved in several different file formats, each having a different file extension for unique representation. Data is stored in cells either in plain form such as text string, numbers, date, currency, etc. or as formulas that change a cell's value when referenced cell values change.

Common spreadsheet file extensions and their file formats include **[XLSX](/spreadsheet/xlsx/)** (Microsoft Excel Open XML Spreadsheet), **[ODS](/spreadsheet/ods/)** (OpenDocument Spreadsheet) and **[XLS](/spreadsheet/xls/)** (Microsoft Excel Binary File Format).
