A **spreadsheet** file contains data in the form of rows and columns. You can open, view and edit such files using spreadsheet software applications such as Microsoft Excel that is now available for both Windows and MacOS operating system. Similarly, Google sheets is a free online spreadsheet creating and editing tool that works from any web browser. A spreadsheet file can be saved in several different file formats, each having a different file extension for unique representation. Data is stored in cells either in plain form such as text string, numbers, date, currency, etc. or as formulas that change a cell's value when referenced cell values change.

Common spreadsheet file extensions and their file formats include **[XLSX](/spreadsheet/xlsx/)** (Microsoft Excel Open XML Spreadsheet), **[ODS](/spreadsheet/ods/)** (OpenDocument Spreadsheet) and **[XLS](/spreadsheet/xls/)** (Microsoft Excel Binary File Format).
