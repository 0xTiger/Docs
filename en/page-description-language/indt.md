## What is an INDT file?

A file with .indt extension is an Adobe InDesign layout template file that contains predefined settings. The design and contents of these files include templates of newsletters, books, magazines, flyer, and print media. Once editing is finished, the INDT file can be saved to disc as [INDD](/page-description-language/indd/) file. User can also create new INDT file from within the InDesign and convert it to other formats such as [PDF](/pdf/), [EPUB](/ebook/epub/), or [JPEG](/image/jpeg/).

Adobe InDesign provides several templates with the software as well as online. These templates provide users with a starting point to design their online or print media. INDT files are light, have plenty of design features (shapes, text, different colors, and filters), and have Infinite resolution.
