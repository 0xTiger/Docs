## What is an OXPS file? ##

The file format OXPS is known as Open XML Paper Specification. Itâ€™s a  page description language and document format. Microsoft is the developer of this format. OXPS file format is very much familiar to these PDF files.  The setup of the OXPS file is the same as an XPS format. The only difference is the description of OXPS as an open format. The .oxps file extension is the most current version of the XPS file format originated by Microsoft and Ecma International. If we talk about the specification, the OXPS and XPS files are used to publish, share, and allocate fixed-layout documents. As a substitute to PDFs, the OXPS file format can store text and multimedia data, with arranging features and printing layout characteristics.

## Brief History ##

The Microsoft team chose Global Graphics to provide consultancy on XPS in 2003, and the development team worked closely with the Windows teams to develop the specification and reference architecture for the new format. Acknowledging the XPS specifications, in June 2007 Ecma International set up Technical Committee 46 (TC46) to develop a standard based on the OpenXPS specification. Ecma International approved Open XML Paper Specification is an Ecma standard (ECMA-388) at the 97th General Assembly held in Budapest on June 16, 2009.

## How to open an OXPS file? ##

The updated software is very important to easily open this file extension. If you are sending someone having a little older version, they could have issues opening the file. To resolve these issues, you should consider converting your OXPS file back to XPS before sending it. You cannot open a .oxps file on a computer having Windows 7 or Windows8 specifically when there is also not an associated software already installed. XPS format is easily being supported in window 7 and 8 as compared to the OXPS file extension. To resolve this issue just Install the OXPS to the XPS converter tool. In the next step use the tool to convert the OXPS file to an XPS file and at the end, use XPS Viewer to open the XPS file. This is the best way to use this file extension.
