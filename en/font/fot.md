## What is an FOT file?

An FOT file is a font file used for font outline data files. It contains information about the overall shapes and outlines of the characters in a font. Other information contained in a .fot file includes font's name, style and its size. FOT files are used by applications that support TrueType ([.TTF ](/font/ttf/) files). It is more often used by application installers during installation of fonts.
