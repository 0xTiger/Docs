## What is a PFB file?

A file with .pfb extension is a Printer Font Binary version of Adobe's Type 1 font. It is similar to .pfa(/font/pfa/) files but are binary in nature. PFB files store Adobe Type 1 fonts used for the windows operating system. These contain glyph's data of the font and stores data in a compact form in binary format. In addition to having binary encoded content, PFB files are encrypted. PFB files also required .pfm files alongside that includes measurements of characters within the font. In order to install PFB fonts, both the .pfb and .pfm files need to be placed in the system.
