## What is a VLW file?

A VLW file is a font format used by the images and animations making software, **Processing**. It stores vector fonts in a compact way that can be scaled to any size without losing quality. This makes its use in graphics and visual design. Processing provides the capability to make images and animations, where these VLW font glyphs are used.

## VLW File Format - More Information

VLW files are saved to disc as binary files. In Processing, you can use the **createFont()** function to create a font object from a VLW file. You can then use this font object to draw text in your sketches using the **text()** function. Processing can read VLW files using the **loadFont()** command.
