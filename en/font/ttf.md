A file with .ttf extension represents font files based on the TrueType specifications font technology. It was initially designed and launched by Apple Computer, Inc for Mac OS and was later adopted by Microsoft for Windows OS. TrueType fonts provide highest quality display on computer screens and printers without any dependency on resolution. All modern applications using fonts are able to work with TTF files. TTF font files are freely available over the internet and can also be converted to other font file formats such as OTF and WOFF.

## **Brief history**

Designed by Apply Computer, Inc in 1980s for MacOS, the TTF font format was aimed at resolving some technical limitations by Adobe's Type 1 format. Apple included support for TrueType fonts in Mac in 1991. The design objective behind TTF fonts was efficiency in storage and processing, and extensibility. Based on this extensibility, existing fonts can be converted to TrueType format.

Microsoft first used the TrueType fonts in Windows 3.1 in April 1992 after Apple agreed to license TrueType to Microsoft. It improved the rasterization mechanism, and improved its efficiency and performance.
