## What is an ETX file?

An ETX file is a font file used by the typesetting systems, TeX and LaTeX. It is saved as a text file and defines the appearance of a font by its encoding. ETX font files are loaded in software that provide the capability for working with Tex documents. Once loaded, the ETX font files can be used for customization of TeX documents.
