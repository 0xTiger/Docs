Have you ever come across and wondered what is an MPP file? MPP and other similar files are Project file formats that are created by Project Management software. A project file is a collection of tasks, resources, and scheduling to get a measurable output in the form of a product or a service. Gantt charts are used to establish a visual flow of activities against time for the identified tasks that can also be exported to PDF or image formats for documentation.

Common Project Management file extensions and their associated file formats include **[MPP](/project-management/mpp/)**, **[MPX](/project-management/mpx/)** and **[XER](/project-management/xer/)**.
