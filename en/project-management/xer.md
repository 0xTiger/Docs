## What is an XER file?

The XER file format is a proprietary project file format used by the Primavera P6 project planning and management application. Like [MPP](/project-management/mpp/) file format, this file format stores data related to project planning such as tasks, resources, timelines, and materials. Primavera is developed by Oracle and provides complete project planning, and finds its applications in several practical fields such as oil and gas, construction, manufacturing, etc. It helps project managers plan, schedule, and control large-scale programs and individual projects by integrating with financial management and human capital management systems. Many software and APIs can read and convert XER files to other popular project file formats such as XML and MPP.

## XER File Format ##

An XER file is a text file and can easily be opened with a text editor. Opening project-related data in a text editor could be helpful, but it is not easy to comprehend it by manually establishing links. This format is the most used one for exchanging data with other P6 databases. It has a relatively low level of control over data that has been imported from another format. XER's advantages on equivalent XML format include the ability to move global codes and calendars to project level and map codes, UDFs, resources, and calendars to existing values.


## Problems to Open an XER file? ##

Some common issues which may arise and cause misfunctioning of the XER format are as follow:

 *   Absence of supporting software
 *   Corrupt file
 *   Infected File due to virus
 *   XER description accidentally deleted from the Windows registry
 *   No access right in the system to open the files
 *   Outdated drive in your system
 *   Extension of the file is renamed
