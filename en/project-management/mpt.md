Files with .mpt extension are [Microsoft Project](https://products.office.com/en-us/project/project-and-portfolio-management-software) template files. These contain basic information and structure along with document settings for creating [.MPP](/project-management/mpp/) files. Such a template file offers default settings such as schedule or budget information for a particular project. It, however, can not save project related data such as tasks, resources or assignments. Once modified, the template files can be saved as standard MPP file for further working with it. Microsoft Project comes with a master template file named "Global.mpt" that is opened when a new template file is to be created. MPT files use application/vnd.ms-project and application/x-project as standard MIME types. MPT files can be opened with Moos Project Viewer, Microsoft Project, and MPXJ programs on Windows, Linux and MacOS platforms.
