## What is an LZO file? ##

A file with .lzo extension is combined with file archiving features that can decrease all files size in the compressed file. All the compressed files may comprise one or more files or even groups of binders with several files of different kinds and dimensions. The size of a compressed file is smaller as compared to the joint size of all files and folders stored in an LZO compressed file. All the LZO compressed files are stored in the LZO format and are explicitly executed with compression features used by the LZOP file compression and decompression software. All the compression specifications are combined into this file compression and decompression program that is originated from the Lempel-Ziv-Oberhume file compression library. Faster decompression speed and developed compression ratios are also combined into these LZO files.

## LZO Specification ##

Markus Franz Xaver Johannes Oberhumer developed the original "lzop" algorithm, based on earlier algorithms by Abraham Lempel and Jacob Ziv, in 1996. This library implements a variety of algorithms with the following characteristics:

* Faster compression than DEFLATE

* Rapid decompression

* Additional buffers that are needed during compression (of 8KB or 64KB size, depending on compression level)

* The source and destination buffers are all the memory required for decompression

* Provides control over both compression ratio and compression speed


As a block compression algorithm, LZO performs overlapping compression as well as in-place decompression. To achieve overlapping compression, the block size of both compression and decompression must match. The LZO compression algorithm splits the input data into matches (a sliding dictionary) and literals that don't match, giving good results with highly redundant data and acceptable results with non-compressible data, only increasing incompressible data by 1/64 of the original size.

## Problems to Open an LZO file ##

Following are the few problems that may cause poor working of LZO file format:
  
*	 The file may be corrupt. To solve this issue, download the file again or ask the sender to resend the file again
*	 The second reason is infected file in this case scan the file properly
*	 Improper links to the LZO file
  *	 Removal of the description of the LZO 
*	 Not enough  hardware resources
*	 Outdated drivers of the equipment
