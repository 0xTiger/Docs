## What is a GST file?

A GST file is a GIS map file format that contains geographic data and visual map of a mapped area. It is used by the **MapX** (developed by UNEP/GRID-Geneva and UNEP for managing geospatial data on natural resources) and **MapXtreme** mapping software (a software development toolkit used to build custom GIS applications) that are online platforms for managing geospatial data on natural resources. A GST file contains geographic information in the form numeric as well as raster images that are overlayed on the map.
