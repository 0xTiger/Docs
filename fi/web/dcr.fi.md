## Mikä on DCR-tiedosto?

A DCR file is a media file that is created and saved in the Adobe Shockwave format. It is used for creation of web games and interactive games similar to those designed and saved in [SWF](/page-description-language/swf/) files. DCR files were earlier created with Adobe Director that was later discontinued after acquisition by Adobe systems. DCR files are similar to SWF files created by Adobe Flash.
